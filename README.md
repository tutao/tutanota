## Building and running your own Tutanota web client

You can build your own Tutanota client and run it locally. Remember that you have to update your Tutanota client on your own. If you prefer the auto-update feature, you can use https://app.tutanota.com directly and upon every update your browser will notify you that the updated app is being installed locally in your browser cache.

#### Pre-requisites:
* An up-to-date version of Git is installed
* An up-to-date version of Node.js is installed

#### Build steps:

1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/tutao/tutanota.git`
2. Switch into the repository directory: `cd tutanota`
3. Checkout latest release (currently 2.15.2): `git checkout tutanota-release-2.15.2`
4. Switch into the web directory: `cd web`
5. Install gulp globally: `npm install -g gulp`
6. Install dependencies: `npm install`
7. Build Tutanota: `gulp dist`
8. Switch into the build directory: `cd build`
9. Open the `index.html` with your favorite browser (tested: Firefox and Chrome). Running Tutanota locally with Chrome requires starting Chrome with the argument `--allow-file-access-from-files`.

## Building and running your own Tutanota Android app
