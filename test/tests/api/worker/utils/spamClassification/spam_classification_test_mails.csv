<b>Copies, Webcasts tangled in draft bill </b><br>
<font size=""-1"">
Legislators are readying a bill that could sharply limit Americans' rights relating to copying music, taping TV shows, and transferring files through the Internet.
At the same time, the draft legislation seen by CNET News.com would place the struggling Webcasting industry on firmer legal footing.

<a name=""h2""><b>Sharp's Zaurus PDA suffers security holes</b></a><br>
<font size=""-1"">
Sharp's Linux-based, business-oriented Zaurus handheld suffers from security holes that could let hackers grab private data off a corporate network, according to researchers at Syracuse University.
In an advisory posted Wednesday to a Syracuse University computer-science Web site, researchers said they had found vulnerabilities in Sharp's Zaurus SL-5500 and Zaurus SL-5000D handhelds. The flaws let attackers take control of the device's file system, giving them the power to overwrite files or lock the device so no data can be input through the keypad or touch screen.

<a name=""h3""><b>Outlook plug-in could let the hackers in</b></a><br>
<font size=""-1"">
A widely used plug-in for Microsoft's Outlook e-mail client that lets users encrypt and digitally sign messages has inadvertently weakened security and left the mail program open to attack.
Security company eEye Digital Security issued a warning late Wednesday to users of Network Associates' Pretty Good Privacy (PGP) plug-in for Outlook, saying that a vulnerability in the add-on could let attackers execute malicious software on a victim's computer. Network Associates released a patch for the problem Wednesday as well.

A clutch of civil liberties groups is asking small Internet service providers to get a backbone and stand up to companies seeking to unveil anonymous critics.
A group including the Electronic Frontier Foundation, the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU), and the Center for Democracy and Technology is urging ISPs to alert customers when they are the targets of so-called John Doe legal actions, which try to unmask the identities of people who anonymously air their companies' dirty laundry. The group has sent letters to more than 100 ISPs, asking them to adopt a written policy promising to let customers know if they're targets.

<a name=""h5""><b>Shareholders sue PayPal, eBay</b></a><br>
<font size=""-1"">
The PayPal-eBay merger has hit an early snag: Two shareholder lawsuits have been filed against the companies seeking to block the deal.
The lawsuits, each filed in Delaware Chancery Court earlier this week on behalf of PayPal shareholders, charge that the deal represents a breach of the companies' fiduciary duty to those shareholders and that the price eBay is paying for PayPal is unfair and inadequate, the companies said in separate regulatory filings on Thursday.

Deflecting continuing calls for a No. 2 executive, Oracle Chief Executive Larry Ellison said again Wednesday that the company does not need anyone to back him up.

This is a good thing.  Getting hammered for stupid investments is likely
to result in smarter investments in the future.  Nobody is supposed to
win all the time, particularly not people who don't do due diligence. 
""A fool and his money are soon parted"" and all that.  It isn't the job
of the FTC/SEC/IRS/etc to make sure you invest your money wisely (and I
have grave doubts that they could even if it was their job).

So what?  Nobody is guaranteed employment.  Laying people off is not a
crime nor is it immoral.  Companies don't exist to provide employment,
nor should they.  The closest we have to such a thing in the US is a
Government Job, and look at the quality THAT breeds.

Perhaps it is just a matter of personal preference, but I'd rather not
live in a ""feed lot"" society, thank-you-very-much.

Bigfoot Story Teller
(1919-2002)
Ray Wallace, a controversial figure involved in 44 years of Bigfoot-related
events, died November 26, 2002, in Toledo, Washington.  The Washington State
construction tycoon had been ill for some time, living in a Toledo rest
home.
It was at Bluff Creek, California, in 1958, which found Ray Wallaces
company building a new road through the northern California forest.   In
August through October, Wallace Construction Company's employee Jerry Crew
found tracks of a huge humanlike foot.  Thanks to instructions from
taxidermist Bob Titmus, Crew made the first plaster casts of a footprint
from this hairy upright creature his fellow workers called Bigfoot.  Crew
took the cast to town, to quiet local ridicule, and showed it to a Humboldt
County newspaper editor.  The photograph of Jerry Crew with the giant
plaster of Paris foot imprint went out over the newswires.   It produced a
revolutionary shift from small regional stories of Sasquatch to todays
global awareness of Bigfoot. Soon after the publicized Crew finds, Wallace
and his brother claimed other Bigfoot activity around the construction site;
Wallace said he found tracks and droppings of Bigfoot.
Wallace was to be involved with the local tales of hairy giants for the rest
of his life.  Allegedly in the later in the 1950s, for example, Wallace
offered to sell Texas millionaire Tom Slick a captured Bigfoot.  Wallace
failed to produce the creature when Slick came up with an offer. Down
through the years, Wallace would carry on pranks, be tied to carved fake
Sasquatch feet, and produce and try to sell dubious photographs and films.
He was a great letter writer and would pen long passages to magazine editors
about this photographs or telling of how he knew a Bigfoot was nearby
guarding a mine full of gold.  After awhile, most Bigfoot hunters and
researchers took Wallace as merely a spinner of fanciful tall tales. Through
his contributions to Strange Magazine, the Track Record, and indirectly to
Fate Magazine, Wallace relished keeping his name in the limelight of the
Bigfoot mystery.
In March 1998, Ray Wallace offered a million dollars to the first person who
could bring him a live baby Bigfoot.  Saying he had tracked Bigfoot for
forty years, Wallace claimed he wanted to raise a young Sasquatch to
adulthood. Wallace told reporters he planned to raise a baby Bigfoot with
care and respect and would like to train the creature to ride around with
him in his pickup truck and help out with chores around his ranch.  No one
came forth with a baby Bigfoot.
Ray Wallace added an intriguing, mostly harmless story-telling element to
the otherwise often serious pursuit of Bigfoot that various friends of his,
such as Ray Crowe, Director of the International Bigfoot Society, enjoyed.
Ray Wallace was interred at the Lone Hill Cemetery in Toledo, Washington
State, on November 30, 2002.

					<P>Does the Securities and Exchange Commission have a press pass yet? It seems to be bringing us all our news lately. On the day of the deadline for companies to certify their financial statements with the SEC, the business press squirmed and waited for the next Enron or WorldCom. (We might eat these words tomorrow, but we doubt it.) In an unrelated confession, IBM gave the commission its latest layoff numbers.</P><P>
IBM talked about pink slips during its second-quarter earnings report, but with a vagueness worthy of your daily horoscope. (""Capricorn: Career changes may be on their way..."") Only after ""months of surreptitious layoff notices"" did the company admit that it's cutting more than 15,600 jobs, said the AP. That's about 5% of its workforce, and a lot more than pundits expected. An IBM spokesperson told the Wall Street Journal the higher number was due to ""rebalancing"" and more employees than
expected taking voluntary layoffs. </P><P>
Sorry, we're still back on ""rebalancing."" Did IBM ""rightsize"" last quarter, too?</P><P>
IBM's news was still trickling out Wednesday morning, but some details were available. About 1,400 workers got cut from IBM's microelectronics unit, and most of the rest were from IT services and consulting. (That ought to make IBM's new employees from PricewaterhouseCoopers feel all warm and fuzzy inside.) Look for news updates from cities that will see the cuts, such as Austin and Raleigh. </P><P>
OK, none of this is good. Two years into the tech slump, we're still tired of seeing people get sacked. But was it really so bad that IBM only revealed it because of new accounting regulations? Nah, Big Blue was always known for ""stealth layoffs,"" as CNN put it, but current corporate scrutiny forced it to 'fess up for once. Until now, IBM would acknowledge the latest layoffs if reporters called and asked, but wouldn't give specifics. Yeesh. - Jen Muehlbauer</P><P>

					<P>Synergy always was a fuzzy concept. Now Vivendi Universal's top man has slammed the lid on it. The French company announced today that it's ready to peddle $9.8 billion in assets to rustle up some cash. First up on the block? Synergy-less U.S. book publisher Houghton Mifflin. </P><P>
It's unclear whether new chairman Jean-Rene Fourtou has genuine turnaround muscle, or whether he and Vivendi's board are simply following the winds of post-merger fashion. But when you owe $18.7 billion, you get real practical, real fast. The Guardian reported that Vivendi's share price sank 5% on Tuesday when investors got the willies about the company's impending announcement on its financial health. But the company had positive news to report: It's making money. Revenue in the first half was 
up 13%, higher than analysts' estimates of a 7.7% boost. </P><P>
Details are scant on the breadth of Fourtou's restructuring efforts, with more information expected at the next board meeting on September 25, according to reporters. Houghton Mifflin, acquired a year ago for $1.7 billion, and a vague explanation that included the ""Curious George"" character, were the only properties named for sale so far. The Guardian speculated that Vivendi will also sell its U.S. video games business and possibly its stake in the French mobile phone company SFR, a debatable
sale because of the cash it generates, according to the newspaper. </P><P>
Meanwhile, Fourtou's predecessor, Jean-Marie Messier, continues to advocate empire-building. The New York Post said its sources say Messier hopes his former employer will feel generous enough to let him continue to reside in his $17 million Manhattan abode. And Bloomberg reported earlier this week that an unrepentant Messier is penning a memoir as he vacations in the Mediterranean. The working title? ""How I Was Betrayed.""  - Deborah Asbrand </P><P>

more than cool --->
quality: snobs only care about mpixels. this is about communications.  the
general public cares about speed not quality.  how is akamai doing these
days? not to mention any other QOS businesses that come to mind.
implementation: point about hooking to usb, wires, etc. AGREE 100%. these
implementations are super clunky, attachable camera needs to be integrated a
la nokia model.  basically useless until better handsets are released i
think.
adoption: ian brought up the 'fax' problem.  brilliant thing is, this is far
more personal than faxes so can be justified more easily and marketed in
family packs etc. but yes, the usual rules apply as MMS phones have network
efx.
content: who cares about content?  that no one can think of 'useful' content
is always the business persons mistake. the content is the users
communications.  its anything and everything.  avg person could easily send
half dozen pics to a dozen people a day.  mainly humorous i'd guess. who
cares if content is trivial in nature. picture speaks a thousand words.
display: why are dig camera displays better than cell phones?  does anyone
know who makes these small displays and what the trends are around them?
misc ramblings: i suppose you skeptical forkers would have said the same
thing about '1 hour photo' processing.  trivial, who needs it, i get better
resultion elswhere.  and yet, it had great decentralizing impact - the plant
had to be downsized and pushed to the retail operation - the digital camera,
and finally the integrated digital camera phone brings this cycle of
decentralization in photography to a logical conclusion (which will put the
photo giants to bed) and change the world in a meaningful way.  also, SMS
didn't take off because its easy, it took off because it costs less.  its
greatly ironic the carriers often trumpet the 'profitabilty' of their SMS
traffic over others because of its ratio of cost to bandwidth.  in reality,
SMS cannibilizes the voice rev's they bought their networks to handle.
ps:  it is relatively amusing that one 'low resolution' complaint dropped
just after Joe watched a CARTOON on his television..
You're right. Or at least, I don't. I saw an advert for it on TV last
night (can't miss Futurama :-) and I thought, ""boy, that's dumb.""
If I wanted to share pictures with someone, I'd email them to them,
where they could see them on a 1024x or 1600x display, instead of

Remote realtime streaming video is neat, but sharing pictures? You invoke
big words rather readily.

Microsoft Tuesday said it has purchased a Mountain View, Calif.-based
security company to better secure its core file services including its
Windows platform and .NET initiative.
The Redmond, Wash-based software giant has acquired the assets of XDegrees
for an undisclosed amount of cash and is in the process of relocating the
team of 12 or 14 engineers to the Microsoft campus.
XDegrees' technology assigns URLs to Word files, video clips, and other
digital documents for access across a peer-to-peer network
XDegrees founder Michael Tanne was offered a job, but decided instead to
play his hand in the Silicon Valley.

""The XDegrees System allows users to easily and consistently locate, access

end-to-end security, the XDegrees System unifies authentication of all
users, provides file-level access control and encrypts all stored and

services for customers on its own hosts, and sells its software to
enterprises so they can define and run their own namespaces on in-house
servers. You can search for a particular person (whatever device the person
is currently using), for a particular device, for a file, or even for a web
service. The software that resolves resource names is called XRNS (the

I've been working on a .src.rpm for it.  Their rpm and spec file is

- --------------------------------------------------------------
* Progress of Senate anti-spam bill
Over a year ago, Sen. Conrad Burns (R-MT) introduced S.630, the CAN
SPAM Act of 2001. This bill would require UCE to have a valid return
address to facilitate consumers' removal from spam lists. It would
place enforcement in the hands of the Federal Trade Commission, and
state Attorneys General. It would also permit Internet Service
Providers (ISPs) to enforce violations, up to $10 per illegal spam.
It would preempt any stricter state anti-spam laws.
The Senate Commerce Committee considered the bill on May 17th, and
reported it out largely unchanged.  It's not now scheduled for further
action in the Senate.
CAUCE has always opposed this bill, since we believe it would lead to
more spam, not less.  When South Korea passed a similar opt-out law
last year, spam from Korea soon increased by a factor of 10.
Our April 2001 press release goes into more detail about the problems
with S.630:
 http://www.cauce.org/pressreleases/pr-s630.shtml
We're pleased that the Congress is looking at spam issues again, and
hope that in the future we can help them create an effective bill that
the entire Internet community can support.

* European Union bans spam
GLOBAL INTERNET COMMUNITY APPLAUDS EUROPEAN ANTI-SPAM VOTE
May 31, 2002 - The Coalition Against Unsolicited Commercial E-Mail
(CAUCE), EuroCAUCE, CAUCE India, CAUCE Canada and the Coalition Against
Unsolicited Bulk E-Mail, Australia (CAUBE.au) today applauded the decision
by the European Parliament to protect European Internet users from the
practice of unsolicited e-mail advertisements. Yesterday's vote will turn
Europe into a virtual ""spam-free zone"" after the formal adoption of the
directive, making it illegal to send unsolicited e-mail, text message or
other similar advertisements to individuals with whom companies do not
have a preexisting business relationship.
""This is a tremendous day for European Internet users,"" said EuroCAUCE
Chairman George Mills. ""We are extremely pleased that the European
Parliament has listened to the citizens of its member countries and added
the right to be left alone by spammers to its efforts to protect the
privacy of Europeans.""
While six European Union member countries had already formalized ""opt-in""
in their national laws and regulations, yesterday's vote should turn all
of Europe into a spam-free zone by the end of 2003.
""Unfortunately, the rest of the world's Internet-using countries,
including the United States, now lag behind Europe in their protection
of Internet users,"" said CAUCE Chairman Scott Hazen Mueller. ""This is
a tremendous first step, but the rest of the world now needs to follow
Europe's lead and unite behind protection of Internet users and
network owners from abusive and costly unsolicited e-mail
advertising.""
""This decision is the direct result of Internet users throughout the
European Union standing up for their rights, and Members of the
European Parliament listening to their constituents,"" said Mills. ""Our
members and our volunteers performed an integral part of this process,
translating, lobbying and educating their representatives.""
More information on the E.U. directive is available on the European
Parliament's Web site <http://www.europarl.eu.int/press/index_en.htm>,
and a EuroCAUCE analysis is available at
<http://www.euro.cauce.org/en/amendments1a.html>. More information on

Possibly another qmail-ism from Bruce Guenter's spam collection.  Or
maybe Anthony's right about spammers being stupid and blindly copying
headers.  (Well, of course he's right about spammers being stupid; it's
just this particular aspect of stupidity that's open to question.)

How were these msgs broken up into the 5 sets?  Set4 in particular is giving
the other sets severe problems, and Set5 blows the f-n rate on everything
it's predicting -- when the rates across runs within a training set vary by
as much as a factor of 25, it suggests there was systematic bias in the way
the sets were chosen.  For example, perhaps they were broken into sets by
arrival time.  If that's what you did, you should go back and break them
into sets randomly instead.  If you did partition them randomly, the wild
variance across runs is mondo mysterious.

Trust me <wink> -- it helps a *lot*.  I expect everyone who has done any
testing here has discovered spam in their ham, and vice versa.  Results
improve as you improve the categorization.  Once the gross mistakes are
straightened out, it's much less tedious to scan the rest by eyeball.

For whatever reason, there appear to be few of those in BruceG's spam
collection.  I added code to strip uuencoded sections, and pump out uuencode
summary tokens instead.  I'll check it in.  It didn't make a significant
difference on my usual test run (a single spam in my Set4 is now judged as
ham by the other 4 sets; nothing else changed).  It does shrink the database
size here by a few percent.  Let us know whether it helps you!

hosting Cinemath, a mathematics film festival: 
    Permutations and Configurations: A Calculated Cinema 
    In this avant-garde subset of Cinemath, we explore films that have been 
    constructed using mathematical concepts both simple and complex- geometric 
    permutations, musical frameworks, even topography are among the strategies 
    that have been employed to compose and sequence film frames. Filmmakers 
    such as Oskar Fischinger and Walther Ruttmann created some of the earliest 
    avant-garde films by multiplying, dividing, and otherwise transforming 
    abstract images- including spirals, rectangles, and circles to produce 
    dynamic rhythms and harmonies. Today such visual music and motion graphics 
    are the currency of digital graphics. Anthony McCall's film performances 
    such as Line Describing a Cone create 3-D geometric shapes into which the 
    viewer can literally step. We also explore films by pioneers of 
    machine-generated and computer-produced animation (Norman McLaren, James 
    and John Whitney, Stan Vanderbeek) as well as works by contemporary 
    animators who use the computer to either generate or pattern images (Larry 
    Cuba, Paul Glabicki, James Otis). Peter Kubelka, Taka Iimura, and Standish 
    Lawder use the frame as the unit with which they create editing patterns, 
    while Kurt Kren and Paul Sharits reckon on arithmetic systems to variously 
    calculate compositional or editing patterns. Bette Gordon, Hollis Frampton, 
    and Bruce Elder figure in algorithms, group theory, and set theory to 
    graphically enliven the frame or to structure their films. While no 
    mathematical knowledge is required to enjoy these films, we count on you to 
    try to calculate the mathematical systems employed!

Last week, <a href=""http://www.axialis.com/"">Axialis Software</a>
released IconWorkshop v5.0 - arguably the most powerful icon
editor / manager for the Windows platform. Ever the icon addict, I
asked for your pixel-perfect creations. I have yet to receive one.
Perhaps you've been waiting for the right motivation? How about a
nice little contest involving some of the most powerful sites on
the Internet? Here's the deal: you create five (or more) icons
between now and the end of July 2002, upload them to your [FREE]
DeviantArt account (under Contests / Axialis Icon Contest), and
one of the five judges may pick it. The panel includes: myself,
MattEO from <a href=""http://www.deviantart.com/"">DeviantArt</a>,
KarmaGirl from <a href=""http://www.wincustomize.com/"">WinCustomize</a>, Voodoo from
<a href=""http://www.neowin.net/"">Neowin</a>, and Marc from
Axialis. We'll each pick our favorite set. The winners will not
only receive one copy of IconWorkshop Corporate Edition, but some
of their icons will get bundled with a future version of the
software! Ownership is retained by the original author, so don't
hold back. Here's your chance at fame and fortune. Or, at least
fame and free software.
<p>
Ah, the life of a software junkie! Pieter just released the new
(unofficial) <a href=""http://www.frysianfools.com/ggsearch/"">Google SearchTool</a>
today. It's much more convenient than the official toolbar (sorry,
I just don't like browser add-ons). I also gave
<a href=""http://www.outertech.com/product.php?product=3"">Cacheman</a>
another go; I haven't used it since Windows 98. It's always been a
great piece of shareware, but I didn't realize it was THIS good.
The speed increase has been quite noticeable (even on Storm Shadow,
my P4 2.5GHz machine). Outer Technologies is brilliant. And so is
<a href=""http://www.repligator.com/"">Repligator 9.0</a>. It gives
me access to instant special effects - a one-stop shop for digital
photo fun. I'm still debating whether or not to install the latest
Java runtimes. It seems to be unobtrusive on my test machine,
which is good to see; I don't want browser integration, I just
wanna run that awesome ASCII Art program. Oh, and ""12 Mistakes
Executives Make When Planning Web Strategy"" is available for FREE
with the purchase of ANY <a href=""http://www.gnometomes.com/"">GnomeTome</a> (including our 50
freshly-released OS X tips). Go grab it if your boss doesn't know
as much as s/he should.
<p>
There's a little bit of Oingo Boingo on <a href=""http://mp3.lockergnome.com/"">Emusic</a> now. They inked a
deal with Universal Music Group today - and I'm not paying any
more to get access to even <a href=""http://mp3.lockergnome.com/"">more MP3s</a>. This is the ONLY
way to go, and I hope and pray that more record labels will
eventually catch on to the craze. The Internet is more than a
place for a pseudo-interactive pamphlet; the Internet fosters
knowledge; the Internet is still in its infancy; the Internet has
encouraged creativity and commerce. The one thing the Internet is
NOT: a fad. Its potential is limitless, as long as it remains
flexible and not controlled by any one company. This
<a href=""http://zdnet.com.com/2100-1107-941111.html"">Palladium</a>
thing has got me more than a little spooked. It, combined with the
service-oriented OS, could very well be the thing that drives
people away from the Windows platform in droves (as much as I hate
to admit it). Software and music pirates unwittingly created DRM.
I best not find out that you're part of the problem.

Everything is nicely divided into categories, too. Need a salad?
Then click &quot;Soups &amp; Salads.&quot; (Easy!) You can also make shopping
lists. The printing capability is nice too, since I'm assuming
most of you don't keep your computer next to the stove. &quot;If you
have an up-to-date computer with Win2000, XP, or 98SE with the

{Sun, moon, and planets} Why is it all the other planets have
really cool names for their respective moon(s), but Earth's is
simply referred to as &quot;moon?&quot; We should change it to something
catchier, like &quot;Joey Joe-Joe Junior Shabbadu.&quot; Don't mind me, I
was just looking at this new application. It shows a graphical
representation of every planet in our solar system (as opposed to
every planet in the Hoth system) and its moons. It also provides
detailed information such as the planet's distance from the sun,
its volume, mass, and gravity in relation to Earth. What I found
most interesting was how long a single &quot;day&quot; lasts on different
planets. Did you know one day on Pluto is equal to six days on
Earth? I guess he chased Chip and Dale around the Christmas tree
for longer than we thought.

&quot;VNC (an abbreviation for Virtual Network Computing) is a great
client / server software package allowing remote network access to
graphical desktops. With VNC, you may allow yourself to access
your machine from everywhere provided that your machine is
connected to the Internet. VNC is free (released under the GNU
General Public License) and it's available on most platforms. The
original VNC distribution can be obtained at the AT&amp;T research
labs site. Here you can find enhanced version of VNC, called
TightVNC (grown from the VNC Tight Encoder project), which is
optimized to work over slow network connections such as low-speed
modem links. While original VNC may be very slow when your
connection is not fast enough, with TightVNC you can work remotely
almost in real time in most environments. Besides bandwidth
optimizations, TightVNC also includes many other improvements,

<B>Pop-Up Menu Navigation Software</b>
    <br>Scribbled by Pat Wong
<P>
 <A CLASS=URL HREF=""http://popup.jscentral.com/"">http://popup.jscentral.com/</A>
<P>
I found some really cool software to generate Web site navigation
menus, and I thought you might be interested in learning about it.
There are several examples on the company's site, as well as on my
own. Here's a small write-up about it; perhaps you'd be interested
in running this in a future Lockergnome issue? We've all seen a
lot of really cool site navigation menus, with pop-up text, neat
mouseover effects, and the like. Most of them require a
combination of HTML and JavaScript to build, which is expertise
that goes way beyond some of us. At last, it's possible to easily
generate just such a menu with some very user-friendly screens to
enter the data you want to use.
<P>
Pop-Up Menu comes in a freeware version, or you can get a fully
licensed version ($34.95 for a Home User license / $129.95 for the
Web Designer license). The biggest difference? With the licensed
version, you get the ability to save a menu you've generated so
you can modify it later. Your only alternative, if you want to
make even a simple change to a menu generated by the freeware
version, is to create the whole menu again from scratch (or diving
into the nuts and bolts of the code and modifying that). Be
forewarned: The JavaScript reads like a novel, so modifying that
could potentially be a nightmare. I decided to buy the fully
licensed version and I'm really glad I did. Sorry if I sound like
a commercial for the company; I don't work for them or stand to be
compensated in any way for recommending them. I just think this
menu system is the greatest thing to come along in a while.

{Calculate it} Calculators aren't just for adding and subtracting
numbers or spelling silly phrases by turning the calculator upside
down. How about figuring out the financing on your new car? What
about the seeding rates for your wheat farm? Perhaps you
programmers out there need a nice HEX calculator. And, of course,
what football fan wouldn't like to calculate the passing rates for
his or her favorite quarterback? If it seems like I'm all over the
map here, it's because this site provides links to all kinds of
calculator sites for all kinds of people. Trust me: it all adds up
to a unique and useful site.

Who knows how to thwart false charges? Lockergnomie Steve
Lafferty: &quot;In a recent article over the PayPal issue, it was
stated that when using a credit card illegally, the owner of that
card is responsible for the first $50.  However, sometging that
very few people know about is that there is a US Federal provision
in the banking industry called 'Reg E' (Regulation E / Electronic
Funds Transfer). This stipulates that all transactions will err in
favor of the customer (account holder). This means that if your
'bank card' is used without your permission, you are not
responsible for any of the charges. My suggestion is never to use
a credit card - and only use your bank debit card. That way, if
someone steals your number, you are not liable for any of the
charges.&quot; For more information, please refer to Section 205 on
FEDERALRESERVE.GOV. Obviously, this tip only applies to people
living in the USA. If you haven't been watching your statements
like a hawk lately, you'd be wise to start soon. Identity theft is
a growing concern. When my wallet was stolen, I found
IDENTITYTHEFT.ORG to be a godsend.

					<P>Another three bite the dust. Three former executives from real estate dot-com Homestore have agreed to plead guilty to criminal charges and repay $4.6 million in stock gains. What's more interesting is that they'll cooperate with an investigation into AOL's role in the dubious dealing. This is the most real estate drama you'll get this week without renting ""Glengarry Glen Ross.""</P><P>
Homestore's former COO was charged with wire fraud and conspiracy to commit securities fraud (up to 10 years in jail), the former CFO with just the conspiracy charge (up to five years), and an ex-VP with insider trading (less time, but unknown). The big accusation here is ""round tripping,"" in which Homestore would buy goods from a company as long as the company then spent most of the money on AOL ads. Then AOL would supposedly spend the same amount of money at Homestore, ""thus allowing
Homestore effectively to 'buy' revenue using its own cash,"" explained the Wall Street Journal.</P><P>
Homestore has become a cause celebre for Attorney General John Ashcroft, who held a press conference to emphasize that the Bush administration really means it about this corporate clean-up thing. Neither Ashcroft, the Justice Department, nor the SEC named names, referring only to Homestore's relationship with ""a major media company."" Nice try for anonymity, but AOL Time Warner was the only major media company Homestore dealt with, observed the New York Times. Now the heat's on AOL while
investigators try and figure out how much of AOL's revenue was inflated like a Thanksgiving Day Parade float.<br>
 <br>
The L.A. Times' sources said AOL execs pointed the finger at former company dealmaker Eric Keller. The Journal led with, and expanded on, this info. It seems two of the three busted Homestore execs are expected to say Keller helped Homestore do its round-tripping, and that some AOL ad revenue that looked legit on paper really came from Homestore. Keller has already been pink-slipped for shady deals with Homestore and another company; his boss got booted last month for possible book-cooking.
</P><P>
So where's the perp walk? The umbrella stand? The theatrics that make the corporate crime beat great? We're kidding (mostly), but that could be why overseas outlets barely noticed this comparatively tame example of American excess. The Journal had one amusing tidbit, though: After Keller got fired, AOL vice chairman Ted Leonsis hired him as a consultant for the hockey team the Washington Capitals, of which Leonsis is the majority owner. Leonsis said he let Keller go after finding out why he
lost his AOL job, but Keller still picked up his Capitals phone as of Wednesday. As outrageous severance packages go, it's no Jack Welsh/GE $9 million annual pension, but it'll have to do. - Jen Muehlbauer</P><P>

					<P>What does Vivendi want to be when it grows up? The media can't figure it out. Can CEO Jean-Ren&eacute; Fourtou? His fuzziness at yesterday's board meeting got reporters to wondering. If he can't explain his vision, does that mean he's lacking the 20/20 clarity that observers on two continents were banking on? For Fourtou, worse than the Monsieur Magoo accusations are the comparisons, starting to bubble through media accounts, that he resembles -- wait, we're rubbing our eyes -- the
vilified Jean-Marie Messier.</P><P>
Media watchers can rate reporters' confusion over Fourtou's latest pronouncements by tallying the amount of space outlets devoted to their coverage of the mess. The New York Times ran 24 paragraphs on the board meeting -- and then filed another 19 in an analysis that sought to examine what the latest moves meant.  The Financial Times posted two articles on the meeting and still had more to say, lambasting Fourtou in Lex, the peach paper's influential column. Lex called the exec's update ""more
like a rambling fireside chat ... than a strategy presentation.""</P><P>
There's little that's clear about what's ahead for Vivendi. The company now says that it will dispose of 12 billion euros worth of assets over the next 18 months. Here's how reporters examining the tea leaves read the current plan: Out are Telepiu, an Italian pay-TV operation, and Canal Plus Technologies, a maker of set-top boxes. On the way out are Vivendi's publishing properties, which include Houghton Mifflin, and a minority stake in a PC gamemaker. That leaves Vivendi's stake in telecom,
via its Cegetel investment, and its Universal entertainment properties, and -- hey, wait a minute, wasn't that Messier's plan, the New York Times wondered by way of an analyst's quote. To confuse matters further, News Corp., the alleged partner in the done deal for Telepiu, says no deal is in place, according to the Financial Times. As for Cegetel, Fourtou said he'd consider selling Vivendi's 44% stake; then again, maybe he'll increase it. And that was all in one post-meeting telephone
conference. </P><P>
The only decision by Vivendi in which Fourtou seemed sure was his claim that the company won't pay any severance to Messier. ""He enjoyed making deals too much and overpaid,"" the Guardian quoted Fourtou as saying, and then adding, ""This all went to his head."" </P><P>
With heads other than Messier's now in question, is Vivendi's viability again in doubt? Outlets today report that Enron's logo, the oversize capital ""E"" that stood outside its headquarters, sold at auction for $44,000. How many euros might a V bring? - Deborah Asbrand</P><P>

It was clear you were talking about averages. But it should 
be equally clear that that isn't what people mean when they
use the word ""promiscuity"".

Not at all. There are still people who only have one partner.
There are many more whoe only have one partner over ""long""
periods of time. So it is far from ""vacuous"" to describe some
people as ""promiscuous"" and others as ""not promiscuous"", 
especially over a set period. (""He was promiscuous in college.
He is no longer promiscuous."")
The word has a clear meaning, despite your continuing tendency 
to gloss that meaning over with population averages.

OK, then. Consider a population of 1,000,000. 500,000 men each
pair off with 500,000 women. Then, 1 man, let's call him ""Wilt"",
also has sex with the other 499,999 women. 
499,999 women have had more than one partner. 499,999 men have
only had one partner. It is now ""perfectly obvious"" that in the
common meaning of the term, among this contrived population, 
that women are ""more promiscuous"" than men -- even though the
single ""most promiscuous"" person, Wilt, is a man.  
""Promiscuity"" is not ""exactly, perfectly identical between males 
and females"", except under a degenerate custom definition of
""promiscuity"".

Averages are useful, sure -- but much more so if called by their 
actual name, rather than conflated with another concept.

Reminds me of a Gary Larson cartoon,
woman walking dog, man walking aligator,
dog mostly eaten by aligator, thought cloud
above man's head,
""This is *such* a great way to meet chicks!""

A flippant remark that I will probably regret  - sure there's assholes 
everywhere. I just remember a lunch in Spain with
a semi-famous American - I think we had about 10 nationalities at the 
table, and he managed to insult each of them within
15 minutes. A historical perspective makes me think that empires - 
Roman, British, Russian, American, whatever - produce
 a larger proportion of assholes than subject nations (and are more 
likely to have them in positions of authority).

todays most profound problems with networked applications are caused by centralization.
Generically, a centralized political or economic system permits only one 
answer to a question, while decentralization permits many separate 
agents to hold different opinions of the same matter. In the specific 
context of software, centralized variables can only contain one valid 
value at a time. That limits us to only representing information A) 
according to the beliefs of a single agency, and B) that changes more 
slowly than it takes to propagate. Nevertheless, centralization is the 
basis for todays most popular architectural style for developing 
network applications: client-server interaction using request-response 
communication protocols.
I believe these are profound limitations, which we are already 
encountering in practice. Spam, for example, is in the eye of the 
beholder, yet our email protocols and tools do not acknowledge the 
separate interests of senders and receivers. Slamming, for another, 
unfairly advantages the bidder with the lowest-latency connection to a 
centralized auction server. Sharing ad-hoc wireless networks is yet a 
third example of decentralized resource allocation. Furthermore, as 
abstract as centralization-induced failures might seem today, these 
limits will _not_ improve as the cost of computing, storage, and 
communication bandwidth continue to plummet. Instead, the speed of light 
and human independence constitute _fundamental_ limits to centralized 
information representation, and hence centralized software architecture.",ham

The GPL and similar licences are explicitly permanent grants of rights
attached to an instance of his work.  (The other stuff mentioned
concerns contract law, e.g., the required element of privity, etc.)

No, the author has the right to issue _additional_ instances under a
different licence, such as a proprietary (""closed"" [sic]) licence.

The analysis, here and elsewhere, concerns contract law.  This isn't
contract law.
This isn't the first time copyright attorneys have stumbled on this
subject.  I'm sure it won't be the last.

Lovely quote from the Forbes 400 list:
""and not a single Astor, Vanderbilt or Morgan rates a mention on the
current Forbes Four Hundred. ""
But you have to studiously ignore the 4 Rockefellers, 3 Gettys, 3
Hearsts,  Fords, Kelloggs, Wrigleys,
and so on.
There are more self-made people on the list than I previously alluded to
- I made a mistake. Most
of them seem to have Ivy League educations, or are Ivy League dropouts,
suggesting to me that they weren't
exactly poor to start with. Some of them have lovely self-made stories
like:
#347, Johnston, Summerfield K Jr

<b>Content Management Is Key:</b> Need a reason your boss should be sending you to Gnomedex? Some of the leading experts on content management solutions (those things we affectionately call blogs) will be sharing the future of blogging and how you can adapt it to both the way you do business and the way you communicate in general. Join Evan Williams and Doc Searls as they share pearls of wisdom on blogging, Linux and other open source applications that are changing our lives. If that's not enough incentive, remind the boss that THE Internet security guru, Steve Gibson, will be sharing his wisdom as well.

This year's <a href=""http://www.sic.org"">SIC</a> gets the blame for the 
lateness of this issue. Lori and I spent Wednesday thru Sunday meeting 
software authors, participating in educational sessions, viewing product 
demonstrations, and most of all having fun. This was Lori's second trip 
to an SIC conference, so she got to reacquaint herself with many familiar 
faces, while I was getting to put faces with many people I've exchanged 
e-mails with over the last several years. As much as I enjoy information 
exchange via computer, the human interaction of meeting people and 
sharing ideas and stories face-to-face is priceless.
<p>
One cool discovery at this year's SIC, pertaining directly to Webmasters, 
is Nick Bradbury's release of 
<a href=""http://www.bradsoft.com/topstyle/index.asp"">TopStyle 3.0</a>. 
Nick's the guy who created HomeSite, long before it joined the Macromedia 
family of products. Version 3 represents a return to those HTML editing 
roots, with the addition of editing capabilities now functioning 
hand-in-hand with the rock solid style sheet building features that 
previously defined  TopStyle. Conversion of existing font tags to CSS is 
just one of several new additions. I should have a full review in one of 
the next two issues.
<p>
Also in the coming soon category - a GnomeTome on Cold Fusion, written by 
one of Iowa's resident ColdFusion experts (who also happens to be an 
expert on an International level), Kevin Schmidt. Kevin wrote the 
<a href=""http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0201758474/ref=ase_lockergnome"""">Training From the Source</a> 
book on Cold Fusion 5 and is currently writing a revision for 
ColdFusionMX. The GnomeTome means we'll have a nice pairing of tips for 
both static pages, in the form of 
<a href=""http://www.gnometomes.com/tome/001691.html"">Dreamweaver tips</a>, and tips on dynamic 
site development with Kevin's tips on ColdFusion.

E-mail remains the killer app of the Internet, despite all the incredible 
artistic efforts by many Web designers. As we all know, e-mail is also a 
source of great frustration and misuse - turning otherwise likeable folks 
into enemies of your inbox defense system. Email 911 aims to educate the 
ignorant, while aiding those of us with a reasonable understanding of 
effective e-mail communication in ways to make e-mail even more useful. 
The newsletters and discussions affiliated with this site should be 
required reading for all corporate users, although home users would most 
certainly benefit as well. For an exceptional look at eliminating junk 
from your inbox, check out the e-book ""What Can I Do About Spam?""

Configure your Apache httpd.conf file in a visual environment instead 
of a text editor. This tool provides a visual representation of all 
configurable options available to Apache admins, offering great 
learning capabilities for newer webmasters, as well as saving time for 
experienced administrators who tire of scrolling through screen after 
screen of configurations. A source view makes manual editing of the 
file easier, by bolding and coloring various configuration directives, 
similar to the way HTML editors mark code. Avoid typos with built-in 
error checking, which provides warnings when invalid directives are 
used.

<b>Making A Commercial Case for Adopting Web Standards</b><p>
<a class=""url"" href=""http://www.maccaws.com/"">http://www.maccaws.com/</a><p>
Supporting standards and writing good code are often things that the number 
crunchers in a business don't feel are as important, when compared against 
getting the product to as many people as possible in the shortest amount of 
time possible in an effort to generate revenue. Communicating the 
importance of standards and good code can be an uphill battle; after all, 
you're just a programmer, right? MACCAWS aims to make your job easier, via 
an open discussion on the establishment of standards that will make sense 
to the folks who control the bottom line. Their mission is to educate 
business leaders by providing you the end user with tools that will help 
make a case for applying standards to your Web efforts. If you've got a 
voice you'd like to add to their cause, visit them on the Web and help 
  influence the course of Web standards development.

I've very excited about the in-planning Penguin Shell volunteer project. 
Apparently, you are too. I've received more than 100 emails from readers <a 
href=""mailto:tony@lockergnome.com?subject=Penguin Shell Volunteer 
Skills"">volunteering</a> a wide range of IT skills for charitable organizations. 


Linux users, Windows users, even a few Mac users are ready, willing and able to 
spend their own precious off time providing qualified technical skills for a 
good cause. I've also gotten more than two dozen suggestions for <a 
href=""mailto:tony@lockergnome.com?subject=Penguin Shell Organization 
Suggestion"">organizations</a> that might be in need of such skills. And, I've 
seen some very interesting suggestions for <a 
href=""mailto:tony@Lockergnome.com?subject=Penguin Shell Volunteer name 
suggestion"">names</a> for our project. Feel free to click through on any of the 
above links to join the ever-growing bandwagon. Do me a favor, though. keep the 
subject lines intact. It's the only way your messages will filter and sort 
through my email system.<p>
It looks like Apple may have crossed a line of irritation with its users. 
According to <a href=""http://theregister.co.uk/content/4/26269.html"" 
target=""_blank"">this</a> article on <a href=""http://theregister.co.uk/"" 
target=""_blank"">The Register</a>, Apple has tacked a $100 annual fee on its
previously free mac.com email service. It's also set the price for an OS 10.2
upgrade at $129.<p>
I won't question Apple's decision too much. Instead, it really proves how 
difficult things have become in the tech world in the past few years. Revenues, 
by and large, are still decreasing from the pie-in-the-sky late 90s and early 
2000. That's left companies to scramble for new sources of income, some of which 


were previously free. Even we at Lockergnome have felt the pinch in the past few 


years. Never fear, though. Chris has assured us that the newsletters will remain 


free. We have, however, begun to explore alternative income <a 
href=""http://www.gnometomes.com/"" target=""_blank"">sources</a>.<p>
On a brighter note, it looks like <a href=""http://www.mandrake.com/"" 
target=""_blank"">Mandrake</a> has found a sweet spot. According to their most 
recent shareholder's report, the third quarter was the strongest in the 
company's
history, with 1.6 million Euro (1.61 million US) in revenue. That doesn't put
them in the black, though. According to MandrakeSoft, the strong quarter will
only decrease operating losses. I have to wonder how much of this revenue was
the result of the <a
href=""http://mandrakelinux.com/en/club/""target=""_blank"">Mandrake Linux User's
Club</a>.<p>
The news also makes me want to pay a bit more attention to Mandrake's newest
partnership venture, an agreement with <a href=""http://www.microtel.com/""
target=""_blank"">Microtel</a> to provide Mandrake-loaded computers for sale on <a
href=""http://www.walmart.com/catalog/product_listing.gsp?cat=102252&dept=3944&path=0%3A3944%3A3951%3A41937%3A86796%3A102252"" target=""_blank"">WalMart.com</a>.
I would never have guessed that WalMart would lead the consumer Linux machine
charge. They've had Mandrake boxes available for several months. Now, with the 
addition of both <a href=""http://www/lindows.com/"" target=""_blank"">Lindows</a> 
and Mandrake-equipped computers, they seem surprisingly ahead of the retail 
computer pack. Let's hope for the best for all involved.<p>
Have a great Wednesday.<p><p>

<b>Checking Mail With KMail</b><p>
I've recently become a KDE convert - impressed enough with KDE-3 to move me from 
my longtime desktop friend Gnome. While I use a combination of fetchmail, 
procmail and pine for reading and filtering my email, KMail is a strong 
contender in the email race. As you'd guess, it's fully integrated into the KDE 
desktop, ready for a quick setup and easy use.<p>
There's one drawback to KMail, though, in my opionion. That's that it doesn't 
automatically check your email by default when the program is opened. As much 
time as I spend talking about saving key and mouse strokes, you knew the 
additional step to check your email after opening the program would be an 
irritation to this Penguin. However, changing the problem is a quick and simple 
configuration issue.<p>
To force KMail to check your email when opened, right-click on the KMail icon in 
your KDE panel. Select ""Preferences"" and the ""Execute"" tab. In the Execute 
window, change the command line to read:<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;kmail --check -caption ""%c"" %i %m<p>
The addition of the --check option will force KMail to bring you your mail when 
you open the program.<p>
Fewer keystrokes make a happy geek, right?<p> <p>

<b>Kernel Configuration - Part XIII</b><p>
As you well know, Linux is simply the most robust operating system for 
networking around. With its roots squarely in the network, Linux has managed to 
stay ahead of the pack in virtually every respect related to networks. It should 
come as little suprise, then, that the network section of your Linux kernel 
configuration is dense with details and options.<p>
I will say that I warned you on Monday - there are going to be some sections of 
the kernel configuration series where I just can't give you a stock 
configuration that will work in every case. Networking is one of those areas. 
You're going to have to give some thought as to how your network is or will be 
used and the level of security you want to provide (both internal and external). 
Then, it's a matter of finding the solutions to those options.<p>
For security issues, I can recommend several good articles and HowTos:<p>
<a class=""url"" 
href=""http://www.linux.org/docs/ldp/howto/Security-Quickstart-HOWTO/index.html"">The Linux Security Quickstart HowTo</a><br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;covers security on a high level, with a good discussion of kernel 
configuration issues<p>

Linux kernel.<p><p>

<b>Linux PR</b><p>
<a class=""url"" href=""http://linuxpr.com/"">http://linuxpr.com/</a><p>
If the daily Linux news sites are starting to get you down, maybe it's time for 
a change. Linux PR is an up-to-the-minute listing of events and developments in 
the Linux world. The layout is attractive, with all the most recent articles in 
descending order on the front page. It makes quick scans easy. The only real 
downside to the news on the site is that some of it is very, very 
company-oriented - clearly the work of PR firms cranking out press releases. 
Other than that, Linux PR is a useful site for checking in and keeping up on 
your favorite OS.<p><p>

It's official: Gretchen, Sprocket, and I will be moving in a few
weeks. Not too far, though. We'll be going deeper into the city of
San Francisco starting on the first of September. Lori and Norm
were here over the weekend (for a photo shoot); in between sets,
Gretchen invited them to join her hunt. They came upon a house
located in one of the busier parts of town. With only street
parking available, I wasn't too thrilled about investigating the
property. However, my wife seemed optimistic. We kinda knew what
we were looking for in a residence (and its neighborhood), but
also knew we'd have to make certain concessions in the process. We
parked (literally) up the hill and found our way to what would
turn out to be our future home (at least, for the next year or
so). It has lots of usable space - which is a premium here. Plus,
the landlords are extremely dog-friendly. Winner! The pictures and
videos will come, never fear.

First order of business: get broadband! According to AT&T's Web
site, cable modem service is not available in the area. However,
DSL is an option. So, it looks like I'm going to be purchasing an
external <A HREF=""http://lockergnome.pricegrabber.com/search_gen.php?form_keyword=dsl%20modem"">DSL
modem</A> in a few days. Any suggestions?
Yeah, I'm not even sure who I'll select for my provider. They
currently use SBC to get online, so I might just stick with them
for continuity's sake. Verizon has been solid enough for me here,
but I believe our loft complex has a unique infrastructure. If I
could make contact with someone from any capable system, I'd
probably go with them. I should probably get the ball rolling
soon, though - I'd hate to play the waiting game for too long.
I've heard of installation nightmares, so I'll probably be rolling
my own (again). 56k is quaint, but hardly enough pipe to get any
real work done. When you download as much as I do, every bit
counts. Oh, and did I tell you about the bites?
<p>

There are plenty of unique restaurants in just about every
direction. Plus, we're right up around the corner from a Peet's
outlet! If you need me, you know where you can find me. I'll
probably also be setting up a Wi-Fi network before too long, too.
My Proxim hardware still works, but I wasn't sure if I needed a
crossover cable to connect it to my router. Furo tells me: ""If the
hub has an uplink port, then a straight cable should work between
the two, as it provides the crossover for you. If both have uplink
and non-uplink ports (workstation attachment ports), then you
would need a crossover cable between like ports. For instance, if
you were connecting a workstation port on one to a workstation
port on another, you'd have to use a crossover. Same for uplink to
uplink."" How's that for home network helpfulness? Oh, if only he'd
do a free <a href=""http://www.gnometomes.com/"">Gnometome</a> for
us...

{Find Web site remnants} Who knows what evils lurk on the hard
drives of mine? I'm always curious about what has been downloaded
to my PC after I have visited a website. I suppose I COULD clear
out my Temporary Internet Files before going to every single
page... or I could just install Traces Viewer. This handy
application gives me the power to see what my PC acquires for
every website I visit. With Traces Viewer's easy-to-read
interface, I can see what files come from each site, and also if
the site contained any cookies.  Mmmmmm, cookies... now, how could

{Make your own icons} I have a compulsive habit of changing the
original desktop and icons in Windows to a version that mirrors my
personality. So what happens if I can't find a desktop or set of
icons that suits me? I load up Pixel Toolbox! This program allows
me to flex my creative skills by creating Windows icons and
pointers. Find yourself in a creativity slump? Well, you don't
have to strain your creative muscle. PixelToolbox allows you to
import an image that you already own, and work from there. If that
isn't enough, you can fashion your own tiled desktop or share your
creation with friends by exporting your masterpiece as a .jpg,
.png, .tga, or .tif file.

<b>Print! v1.6 [319k] W9x/2k/XP US$39</b><br>

{Screen print utility} Time is money, and I endorse any program
that can save me time. Luckily, that is exactly what Print! v1.6
does. Say that I want to share screenshots with my other tech
friends to compare error messages and talk about possible fixes:
every time I take a screen shot, I open up Word, paste the
snapshot, and THEN I can print it. Too many steps, too much of my
time! With Print!, I just hit my ""Print Screen"" key and out comes
my screenshot without involving any other programs. Don't want a
screenshot of your whole desktop? Not a problem, just press Alt +
Print Screen and you'll have a printout of the active window only.
Print! 1.6 goes so far as to put the date and time on your
printout too... perfect for saving those high scores on solitaire!
Other features include scaling, centering, and the ability to
invert images. (So, not only will you save time, you'll also save
on toner. Bonus!)  You may also want to note that Print! saves
your printer configuration without wreaking havoc on the settings
in your other programs. You'll definitely get your money's worth
with this program. Don't believe me? Start by checking out the
evaluation version for yourself!

Gretchen is a self-professed pack rat: there are just some things
that she can't throw away. For example, books. I, on the other
hand, prefer my text in an electronic medium, and don't really
miss those analog versions. (What's that stuff called again?
Paper?) Many of my books are gathering dust on the bookshelf. The
alternative? Free them into the wild! BookCrossing is essentially
a worldwide book club. You register online and get a BookCrossing
ID number to put on your books with a note sending the new reader
back to BookCrossing (think of wheresgeorge.com). Then you just
leave the book ""in the wild"" to be found by someone else; the
folks at BookCrossing suggest a park bench, the pocket of an
airplane seat, or just plain giving your book to a friend. ""Sounds
easy, right? Well it is. It's also a fascinating exercise in fate,
karma, or whatever you want to call the chain of events that can
occur between two or more lives and one piece of literature. Oh,
and we should mention, it's absolutely free and absolutely
private, too."" BookCrossing also offers book reviews, ratings, and
recommendations.

Any modem that relies on Windows to function is dubbed a
""Winmodem."" Most manufacturers use ""Winmodems"" because they are
cheap and easy to set up on a standard model PC. I don't have any
problem with the manufacturer saving money (because living in a
capitalistic society, I would hope that the savings would trickle
down to ME in one way or another). I do, however, have a problem
with the way ""Winmodems"" function after you add more internal
devices to your PC. ""Winmodems"" rely on Windows to mediate their
serial communication (I/O address, COM port, IRQ, etc.) and as you
can imagine, the more devices Windows has to manage, the higher
the probability of running into a problem. And what if you want to
run Linux instead? Will the ""Winmodem"" function well, if at all,
in an operating system other than Windows? Don't bet on it! If you
want to make sure you don't have any problems after upgrading your
system, you'll want to get yourself a hardware modem. How can you
determine this? Checking a modem's system requirements. If the
modem says it REQUIRES Windows, then keep looking... you've found
yourself a ""Winmodem."" However, if the system requirements for the
modem say that it will work with Linux, then you've found yourself
a hardware modem. Yes, it IS that easy.

COMMENTARY
Rebuild at Ground Zero
By LARRY SILVERSTEIN
Earlier this month, we New Yorkers observed the solemn anniversary of the
horrific events that befell our city on Sept. 11, 2001. All of those who
perished must never be forgotten. The footprints of the fallen Twin Towers
and a portion of the 16-acre site must be dedicated to a memorial and civic
amenities that recall the sacrifices that were made there and the anguish
that those senseless acts of terror created for the victims' families and,
indeed, for all of us.
But for the good of the city and the region, the 10-million-plus square
feet of commercial and retail space that was destroyed with the Twin Towers
must be replaced on the site.
About 50,000 people worked in the World Trade Center. Those jobs are lost,
along with those of another 50,000 people who worked in the vicinity.
Together, those jobs in lower Manhattan, for which the Trade Center was the
economic stimulus, produced annual gross wages of about $47 billion, or 15%
of the annual gross wages earned in the entire state. Some of the firms
have relocated elsewhere in the city and region, but many have not. New
York City is facing a budget deficit. Without additional jobs, the deficit
may become permanent. This is one reason for the importance of rebuilding.
If we do not replace the lost space, lower Manhattan never will regain the
vibrancy it had as the world's financial center. Love them or hate them,
and there were lots of New Yorkers on both sides of the issue, the Towers
made a powerful statement to the world that said, ""This is New York, a
symbol of our free economy and of our way of life."" That is why they were
destroyed. This is a second reason why the towers must be replaced, and
with buildings that make a potent architectural statement.
In recent weeks, redevelopment proposals have been circulated from many
sources. Most of these focus not on the Trade Center site, however, but on
all of lower Manhattan. Further, many believe that the 10 million square
feet either could be located elsewhere, scattered in several sites, or
simply never rebuilt.
These proposals miss the point. What was destroyed, and what must be
recovered, was the Trade Center, not all of lower Manhattan. Except over
the towers' footprints, where there must be no commercial development, the
office and retail space lost has to be rebuilt on or close to where it was.
Access to mass transit makes the site ideal for office space of this size.
That was a major reason why the Twin Towers were leased to 97% occupancy
before 9/11. None of the other sites proposed for office development has
remotely equal transportation access. With the reconstruction of the subway
and PATH stations, plus an additional $4.5 billion in transit improvements
planned, such as the new Fulton Transit Center and the direct
""Train-to-the-Plane"" Long Island Rail Road connection, the site becomes
even more the logical locus of office development.
And New York will need the space. Before 9/11, the Group of 35, a task
force of civic leaders led by Sen. Charles Schumer and former Treasury
Secretary Robert Rubin, concluded that the city would need an additional 60
million square feet of new office space by 2020 to accommodate the
anticipated addition of 300,000 new jobs. The loss of the Twin Towers only
heightens the need.
As for those who say that 10 million square feet of office space downtown
cannot be absorbed by the real estate market, I would simply point out that
history shows them wrong. New York now has about 400 million square feet of
office space. All new construction underway already is substantially leased
up. New York had 48 million square feet of vacant office space at the
beginning of the recession in 1990. By 1998, this space had been absorbed,
at an annual rate of about 6 million square feet.
We are seeking to rebuild 10 million square feet on the Trade Center site
over a period of about 10 years, with the first buildings not coming on
line until 2008 and the project reaching completion in 2012. This is an
annual absorption rate of about a million feet, much lower than the 1990s'
rate.
Those who argue that New York cannot reabsorb office space that it
previously had are saying that the city has had its day and is entering an
extended period of stagnation and decline. I will not accept this view, nor
will most New Yorkers.
Mayor Michael Bloomberg said in a recent interview with the New York Times
that the city ""has to do two things: memorialize, but also build for the
future."" I believe that the Twin Towers site can gracefully accommodate --
and that downtown requires -- office and retail space of architectural
significance, a dignified memorial that both witnesses and recalls what
happened, and cultural amenities that would benefit workers as well as
residents of the area.
The challenge to accomplish this is enormous. But our city is up to the task.

We're in violent agreement there:  the comments in tokenizer.py say that as
strongly as possible, and I've repeated it endlessly here too.  But so long
as I was the only one doing serious testing, it was a dubious idea to make
the code maximally clumsy for me to use on the c.l.py task <wink>.

Yup, the system picks up on *everything* in the tokens.  Graham's proposed
""delete as ham"" and ""delete as spam"" keys would probably work very well for
motivated geeks.  But Paul Svensson has pointed out here that they probably
wouldn't work nearly so well for real people.

I'll soon check in this change:
    def tokenize_body(self, msg, retain_pure_html_tags=False):
                                 ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
        """"""Generate a stream of tokens from an email Message.
        If a multipart/alternative section has both text/plain and text/html
        sections, the text/html section is ignored.  This may not be a good
        idea (e.g., the sections may have different content).
        HTML tags are always stripped from text/plain sections.
        By default, HTML tags are also stripped from text/html sections.
        However, doing so hurts the false negative rate on Tim's
        comp.lang.python tests (where HTML-only messages are almost never
        legitimate traffic).  If optional argument retain_pure_html_tags
        is specified and True, HTML tags are retained in text/html sections.

My impression is that a pre-collected corpus would not fit most individuals
very well, but each individual (or group?) should collect their own corpus.
One problem that comes upp immediately: individuals are lazy.
If I currently get 50 spam and 50 ham a day, and I'll have to
press the 'delete' button once for each spam, I'll be happy
to press the 'spam' button instead.  However, if in addition
have to press a 'ham' button for each ham, it starts to look
much less like a win to me.  Add the time to install and setup
the whole machinery, and I'll just keep hitting delete.
The suggestions so far have been to hook something on the delete
action, that adds a message to the ham corpus.  I see two problems
with this: the ham will be a bit skewed; mail that I keep around
without deleting will not be counted.  Secondly, if I by force of
habit happen to press the 'delete' key instead of the 'spam' key,
I'll end up with spam in the ham, anyways.
I would like to look for a way to deal with spam in the ham.
The obvious thing to do is to trigger on the 'spam' button,
and at that time look for messages similar to the deleted one
in the ham corpus, and simply remove them.  To do this we
need a way to compare two word count histograms, to see
how similar they are.  Any ideas ?
Also, I personally would prefer to not see the spam at all.
If they get bounced (preferably already in the SMTP),
false positives become the senders problem, to rewrite
to remove the spam smell.
In a well tuned system then, there spam corpus will be much
smaller than the ham corpus, so it would be possible to be
slightly over-agressive when clearing potential spam from
the ham corpus.  This should make it easier to keep it clean.
Having a good way to remove spam from the ham corpus,
there's less need to worry about it getting there by mistake,
and we might as well simply add all messages to the ham corpus,
that didn't get deleted by the spam filtering.
It might also be useful to have a way to remove messages from
the spam corpus, in case of user ooops.

Red Hat 8.0 ships with the bytecode hinter enabled; I think 7.3 may have 
as well.
The enabling change to ""ftoption.h"" is made by Red Hat's SRPM before 
building.  Take a look at ""freetype-2.1.1-enable-ft2-bci.patch"" from the 
SRPM; it's pretty clear that this does exactly what needs to be done.
So if your fonts look ugly, lack of bytecode hinting is *not* the cause.

I tend to prefer the Harvard Business Review

time writing about who's sleeping with whom and
come up with real statistical models.

Yes, the public key of the signature you want to check :-).
Are you really sure that you have the public key of the message's

I havent used the FBSD poll, as it's not portable, select and poll(still not
100%) are all that exist in the UNIX world. Redhat of course doesnt count as
portable either, but it's nice they are trying. The Windows I/O model does
definately blow the doors off the UNIX one, but then they had select to
point at in it's suckiness and anything would have been an improvement. UNIX
is just now looking at it's I/O model and adapting to a multiprocess
multithreaded world so it's gonna be years yet before a posix API comes out
of it. Bottom line is the ""do stuff when something happens"" model turned out
to be right, and the UNIX ""look for something to do and keep looking till
you find it no matter how many times you have to look"" is not really working
so great anymore.

I'll post my own repository story here anyway, hope no-one minds.
It may freely be commented on or used in another text.
I have a directory like this:
$ tree  -d
.
|-- current7
|   |-- SRPMS.current
|   |-- SRPMS.gcc3
|   `-- redhat
|       |-- RPMS.current
|       |-- RPMS.gcc3
|       `-- base
|-- redhat-7_2
|   |-- SRPMS.os
|   `-- redhat
|       |-- RPMS.os -> <link to RH network install image>
|       `-- base
`-- testing
    |-- SRPMS.testing
    `-- redhat
        |-- RPMS.testing
        `-- base
27 directories
I throw updates to current7's rpms and my own stuff (with makefile :) to
testing.
After each new package, 
nice genbasedir -s --progress --topdir=$TOPDIR/ \
testing/redhat testing
(for -s to work, you need to make release files, pinch someones for
exmple)
This stuff is found under apache. I put that url, my keys and all that
into apt conf on the machines on the network and apt away.
As for .fi mirrors, funet is very slow. I think I use tuxfamily for
updates but when I see errata I usually also put that to my own one so
rest of the machines have a shorter path to it.
Funet hosts a whole load of mirrors and projects (it used to be (is?)
the main mirror for Linux. It was one of the big pub ftp sites). If
there was a definite apt repository, maybe they might mirror that as
well. I doubt RH would be very keen on using apt and forking a
distribution doesn't seem like an easy option, someone should just start
a project.

Well, shiver me timbers, but my favorite pirate phrase is missing from

*Q AND A SECTION*
*SHIVER MY TIMBERS*
/From Tad Spencer/: ""Please could you tell me where the phrase /shiver 
my timbers/ originated?""
This is one of those supposedly nautical expressions that seem to be 
better known through a couple of appearances in fiction than by any 
actual sailors' usage.
It's an exclamation that may allude to a ship striking some rock or 
other obstacle so hard that her timbers shiver, or shake, so implying a 
calamity has occurred. It is first recorded as being used by Captain 
Frederick Marryat in /Jacob Faithful/ in 1835: ""I won't thrash you Tom. 
Shiver my timbers if I do"".
It has gained a firm place in the language because almost fifty years 
later Robert Louis Stevenson found it to be just the kind of old-salt 
saying that fitted the character of Long John Silver in /Treasure 
Island/: ""Cross me, and you'll go where many a good man's gone before 
you ... some to the yard-arm, shiver my timbers, and some by the board, 
and all to feed the fishes"". Since then, it's mainly been the preserve 
of second-rate seafaring yarns.",ham

I was just a tall, goofy looking kid in middle school
with buck-teeth and freckles.  Each day in the
cafeteria, I walked from table to table ...
Stealing other kids' lunch money.
No, I didn't rob them with a gun or a knife - I just made
them a little deal.  ""Let me borrow two dollars today,"" I said,
""and I'll bring you five dollars next week.""  The investment
was too good to pass up, and other kids were throwing their
lunch money at me like gravy on mashed potatoes.  Of course 
when ""next week"" rolled around and I couldn't pony up the cash,
I promised to pay them even more the week after that,
if they would just let me keep their investment a little bit 
longer.
Eventually the end of the year came and went, high school
started and with it came girls, and homework, and parties,
and sports, and those poor kids from eighth grade had more 
things on their mind than last year's lunch money.
I made off with a tidy sum for a middle school kid,
and I didn't even get beat up.
Hidden inside this story are the two greatest stock market 
secrets you will ever learn.
First of all, greed is your number one enemy. You're not
going to turn $2 into $5 in a week, so cash out when
you're ahead.  Don't wait for the boat to sink before 
grabbing the lifejacket.
Second, never trust an investment adviser of any kind.
They are looking out for their own money, not yours.
The ""professionals"", those stuffy investment counselors and
money managers, will always tell you that the best time to
buy is NOW.  According to those guys, the longer you keep
your money in the market, the more money you're going to make.
Ask them when is the best time to sell and their answer is
""NEVER"".  
In a sense, they are right.  If you put $250,000 in an index
fund right now, you'll probably have over a million dollars
in thirty or forty years.  But here's the problem:
Do you want to WAIT thirty or forty years to be rich?
Hell no!
You want the money NOW - so you can enjoy it. It's hard to
make use of your fortune when you're seventy years old 
in a wheelchair.  If you could make a million dollars in
the next few years, what would you do with it?  Where would
you travel?  What kind of car would you buy?  
The fact is ... youth is the best time to be rich.
If your goal is to make quick profits in the market, volatility
is your ally, and stability your enemy.  You want to see
those large upswings, two hundred points in a day, followed
by the four hundred point crash a week later.  You don't
care if the market went up or down 20% this year as long
it was UNSTABLE.  That's how you're going to make the 
money.
What I'm talking about here is day trading.  
My father invests the traditional way; he holds some good stocks 
and he goes up 30K and down 30K. In the long term of 5-10 years 
he makes money. 
The day trader buys or sells 5,000 shares of XYZ for a
$25,000 profit in a 5-10 minute trade.  He acts quickly, taking 
advantage of all the information at his disposal about a 
certain stock, and estimating whether it will go up or 
down within hours, sometimes within minutes.  
I can teach you how to do this - and how to make amazing 
amounts of money at it.  It's not rocket science, and you 
only need to learn a few basic principles to get started.
Society would have you believe that successful trading is 
complicated and requires formal training.  
The truth is, wealthy people use very simple investment 
strategies to make money.  
Popular media and investment professionals portray successful
trading as difficult and complex to scare you out of the boxing
ring.  They don't want the competetion - and they sure as hell
don't want you paying a few dollars to an online trading firm
to execute a trade for which they'd charge you forty or fifty 
dollars.
They make their money only if you believe two lies:
1) That investing is too difficult and risky for the average 
person.
2) That using an investment adviser who charges a high 
commission is safer than trading online for a few bucks 
per trade.
Here is what the financial gurus in today's society absolutely,
positively DO NOT WANT YOU TO KNOW ...
The strategies for profitable day trading are in fact
so simple that anyone can do it - provided they spend
a few hours of studying.  
After reading over 200 financial books and publications
during the past decade, and after using day trading
to successfully make more than four million dollars in
the stock market, I've learned the following lessons:
** Achieving financial success is incredibly simple.
** Anyone can do it.
** It only takes a few hours to learn.
When I discovered the secret to day trading, I didn't become
wealthy overnight.  If you want instant cash, drive to Wal-mart. 
Buy a ski mask and a shotgun, and rob your local bank. The 
only way to get rich, quick or otherwise, is through
hard work, knowledge, and determination.
After learning the fundamentals of day trading, I started 
practicing the trading art itself, and the first few weeks
brought modest gains.  The next few months gave me the practical
experience I needed to really earn a living, and I was pulling
close to a six figure income. In less than three years with no 
formal financial training, minimal effort and only moderate risk,
I had made my first million.  The knowledge that I gained 
during those formative trading years I am willing to share
with you in my new book, the Master Trader.  You will learn from
my mistakes, and from my successes, as I teach you the simple,
secret formula for day trading that I've used profitably
year after year.
The income of the day trader can be staggering.  Thousands, even 
hundreds of thousands of dollars can be made or lost within
minutes.  The difference between making money and losing your 
shirt is simply this: knowledge.  I will provide that knowledge,
and I will give you a winning edge at this high-stakes game. 
Average Income of a Day Trader: 
5% average an income in excess of $500,000 per year
22% average an income in excess of $250,000 per year
35% average an income in excess of $100,000 per year. 
27% average an income between $50,000 and $99,999 per year 
11% average an income between $20,000 and $49,999 per year 
After reading the Master Trader, you will discover extremely 
profitable, simple yet powerful trading methods that give 
you an almost unfair trading advantage and make you 
win DESPITE the current market weakness. 
Here is just a snippet of what I will teach you:
*** Make money whether a stock goes up or down.

*** Learn how to get in and out of stocks within split seconds.

*** Learn exactly what stocks to trade, the exact price to 
buy them and the exact price to sell them. 

*** Save thousands of dollars by learning to avoid the 
mistakes beginners make.

*** Learn how to trade stocks like a pro and how to make money 
consistently in every market! 

*** Learn proven strategies that give you the highest chance 
for great success. 

*** Profit on huge intraday price swings.

*** Make money on the biggest news stories.

*** Actively manage your risks and learn how to realize maximum
returns. 

*** Learn how to use the tools and information Wall Street 
professionals use.

*** Learn how to develop and maintain a winning state of mind. 

It's time to ask yourself: ""Am I going to listen to the 
Professionals who say BUY BUY BUY but never sell?  Or am
I going to take control of my own financial future, and
start making money RIGHT NOW in the stock market?""
Who is looking out for your best economic interests - some
wealthy Wall Street stockbroker, or yourself?
With the Master Trader e-book, you will learn everything you 
need to know in order to get started with Day Trading ... from 
choosing the best broker in order to take advantage of the 
lowest commissions and instant order executions to professional 
trading strategies that make professional traders millions of 
dollars.
The Master Trader e-book is the most comprehensive yet easy to 
understand and straight-forward book ever written about active 
trading. If you are serious about success in short term stock 
trading - ORDER TODAY and start paving the road to your
own financial future.
Oh, and remember that scraggly kid in the eighth grade?
His high school friends laughed when he said he was going to 
make money in the stock market.  
Six years later, he bought a beach-front home on the California
coast - WITH CASH.  Oops, they weren't laughing anymore.
In a rollercoaster market like we have today, day trading
is the fastest track to wealth.  If you're looking
for a long-term retirement investment with no risk 
that goes up 5% a year, then by all means, this ain't
your kind of game.
But if you want the QUICKEST possible way to make a FORTUNE
in the market, with the lowest element of risk, then
order the MASTER TRADER e-book right now.  I promise
to teach you ALL of the secrets that helped me become a
millionaire through successful day trading.
You don't need to know anything about the market, and
anyone can do it, with minimum effort.  It's an easy
game to win if you know how the pieces move.

Flist_FindUnseen has changed to Flist_FindSeqs.  It takes the same arguments,

That got a good laugh out of me.   Just saying ""crucial hair feature"" 
improves my day immeasurably.
I've done a fair amount of thinking about the ""media intermediated"" meeting 
thing.   It seriously loses for reasons like Rohit's just encountered.   
One is both rejected for trivial reasons and rejects for the same.
Some people loudly defend that these choices are not trivial.
I'd have never met my best friend if I had to pick her out of a crowd for 
getting to know.   I was a teen at the time, but I won't say I'm much 
improved at being able to spot ""interesting"" at a distance.   Interesting 
isn't an external thing.  I have that brought home to me again every so 
often.  I may think that interesting people dress differently or whatever, 
but that's total superstition.   How do I know what your version of 
creative attire is?  Maybe it's purely functional.
I was at a loud party recently, sufficiently loud that conversation of any 
kind was extremely difficult, and intoxication was the norm.   I was 
working on what my algorithm for meeting people there should be and one of 
the candidates was ""women, in order of attractiveness.""   I flinched from 
that, rather violently.   At a trade show, or something, I might elect to 
talk to the people who are looking at interesting exhibits.   At a 
party.....well, if you can't hear the conversation they are having, or if 
on the net all you have is a photo.....
You just can't tell important things from a picture and a few words.  It's 
not how we are built.   There's no geek code for the heart and soul.
(And if there were people would lie and game the system.)
It's too easy to say ""Oh, no!  He's a geek!""   or ""She's a CAT person, 
ick!"" when you might have a great time together.
We are constructed to form alliances based on how we fit together as 
people, how we feel in the other person's company, how well we partner on 
tasks and recreation.   This is all entirely speculative based on nothing 
but superstitious association unless you actually have time in the 
person's company.   Which is why we tend to be screwed when our circle of 
exposure shrinks after school.
Personally, as a writer, the whole internet meet & email thing ought to 
work better for me than it does for other people, but interestingly, it 
doesn't.   I have to put out the same amount of effort and reap about the 
same poor results.    I have to think it's not the people, but the tool.
An aside (okay, yes, I'm a tool geek):  Speed Dating
Speed Dating (aka 7 Minute Dating) is a live-action stab at actual time in 
the company of a variety of people, compressed into one event.   I think 
it's noticably better, but still absolutely nothing like working on a 
project together, cooking, climbing a mountain or whatever.
It was, in fact, invented as a jewish thing seeking to match up the young 
people to avoid total assimilation.   It has too much ""interview"" context 
and no shared activity beyond that.   I give it several points for effort 
though. 
I guess my impression that even the Speed Dating thing doesn't do much for 
you means that the traditional advice of ""join activities groups"" is 
actually sound.

Yea, and that on top of the 100x of all the parsing engines over just
bigendian'ing it and passing the data (5x+++) in the raw. Then it REALLY

I am curious as to whether a spammer has begun to try contacting razor users

I hadn't tried that.  I figured it was better to find out if ""all but

Well, I'm sure you can recompile those game packages without ALSA anyway.
Also, note that ALSA 0.9.x has just appeared in Mandrake 9.0 and that all
previous Mandrake releases were using the incompatible, aging and now

Near to none, it should be quite straightforward :
http://freshrpms.net/docs/alsa/
The only tricky part is editing the /etc/modules.conf file, but the ALSA
Soundcard Matrix has a page for every supported card with a section you can
most of the time simply copy and paste!
I really think that with my ALSA packages, ALSA on Red Hat Linux has never
been so easy! ;-)

I haven't been to Van in years, but I do know that in Toronto, outside
of the small deeply ethnic neighbourhoods, if you stray more than 50
feet from Wellesley and Jarvis or Queen and Spadina, you're in
doughnutland; there's far more like the eateries in the Eaton Centre
than there are quaint cafes like McCaul north of Dundas, and the rare
little eateries are not brimming with lunchtime traffic (you can still
find a seat at noon at Village by the Grange)
When most of Toronto does not live in those neighbourhoods but instead
lives in Scarborough, Malton, Mississauga and Markham (franchisevilles), you
will quickly see that one or two trendy strips does not save an entire
nation.

What does that exactly have to do with the statement that
distruption of peacable political assembly has become
a common practice disruption tool?  It's an observation
not a judgement, comment, approval.  You've focused on the
word ""muddy"" to use it in a different context than the one
I posted.

I was trying to be too clever with my writing this morning.

mplayer works with dga (if i am root) and works with x11

kernel by hand.  I'd like to humbly offer a tweak to alsa-driver.spec 
that helps it build cleanly under such circumstances.  I recognize that 
freshrpms.net packages are designed with standard Red Hat in mind, 
including a standard kernel RPM.  However, I hope that Matthias will 
consider the tweak small enough to justify its incorporation.
The diff is attached below.  The first part of the diff contains a 
conditional that checks to see if the expected RPM is installed.  If it 
is, %{karch} is set as before and a new %{krpm} flag is set to 1.  If 
the expected RPM is not installed, then %{karch} is instead set using 
""uname -p"", while %{krpm} is left undefined.
The second part of the diff is simpler.  We only require that 
kernel-source be installed if the kernel itself came from an RPM.  (If 
the kernel was hand-built, the presumably the user knows enough to have 
retained the sources in the expected place.)
Again, I realize that I'm operating ""off warrantee"" by not using a Red 
Hat kernel RPM.  Matthias, if you think this tweak is reasonable and not 
too ugly, I'd love to see you pick it up.  If not, well at least this 
message will sit in the archives and may help other folks in the future.",ham

 Why would a customer use `spamassassin -t` without understanding what it does?

Wednesday's trip went fairly smooth overall, and I actually 
enjoyed helping out my friend Larry with some server 
software installation and network configuration tasks. His 
kids seemed impressed with the new ability to copy files 
between the five different computers and have Internet 
access at any of them. Ahh, yes... geeks in the making.
<p>After that project was finished, I met up with Jake at a 
nearby Starbucks to shoot the breeze and catch up on all 
things Lockergnome. We email all the time, but it's nice to 
have a face-to-face conversation for a change. He had just 
finished establishing new phone service with Verizon, so he 
has a fun new PalmOS-based phone to play with.
<p>After the dose of caffeine, I headed up to Boone, Iowa to 
hook up with my cousin Casey and his wife of two months, 
Stephanie. Their new house is awesome, but disappointing, as 
there was no high-speed Internet connection or wireless 
networking. We'll have to fix that. For now, I'll remain 
impressed with the geothermal heating/cooling system and the 
vast potential of the unfinished basement that will someday 
make an incredible rec room [insert suitable Tim Allen grunt 
here]. 
<p>Casey is ticked about all of the rain recently because it 
keeps eroding his dirt front yard into the drainage ditch. 
The back yard is in great shape, as there was sod laid after 
construction finished up, but he decided to save a few bucks 
and seed the front himself next spring. This now assumes 
that he'll have a front yard left by then.
<p>The rain turned out to be the last event of the evening. 
I drove through the beginning of the storms on the way from 
Ankeny to Boone, and I just knew it was going to be a rough 
drive home later since they were only getting started at 
that time. I was correct. What would normally be an hour and 
45 minute drive turned into nearly two and a half hours and 
many, many animal sightings. As the night wore on, I was 
half expecting to see someone building an ark in a 
cornfield. Must have been where the animals were headed.
<p>The rain guage at home showed 3.25"" this morning, adding 
to the 1.25"" and 2.5"" amounts dumped out of it within the 
last week. I considered setting the sprinkler up in the 
front yard today as an attempt at neighborly humor, but 
figured I'd just be labeled as a complete moron instead. 
<p>So, what did I forget to take with me, you ask? 
Directions to Larry's house. DOH! I had to dig out the 
notebook at a close rest area in a vain attempt to quickly 
memorize the route. Instead, I decided to transcribe the 
list on my Jornada, which would be far easier (and safer) to 
read as I navigated through the streets. There's still a use 
for printers in this world, without question. Reading text 
from the tiny screen bites. Larger print and bold text on a 
sheet of paper is the way to go. At least I didn't leave my 
PDA at home as well, which I actually considered doing.

<b>Satellite Internet Delays Add Up</b>
<p><a class=""url"" href=""http://www.skycasters.com/supervpnwhitepaper.htm"">http://www.skycasters.com/supervpnwhitepaper.htm</a>
<p>Have you considered moving to a satellite Internet 
provider at some point? While all of the marketing hype 
paints a rosy picture, there are a couple of things that you 
really must consider before writing the check. The birds are 
some 23,000 miles above the surface of the planet, so there 
is a significant delay while the bits float up and back 
down. The absolute minimum time for a packet to get from one 
place to another is nearly a quarter of a second. Add in 
hops across the Internet and other hardware latency and it's 
common to see ping times of between 500 and 1000 
milliseconds - an eternity when you're talking about TCP/IP 
connections. Now consider how VPN connections are affected, 
being that they are generally significantly slower on the 
ground without the extra 46,000 miles. Ouch! This white 
paper is a tad marketing driven, but I think their 
explanation of technology and how they are addressing VPN-
over-satellite connections is quite informative.

<p>Even encryption software is potentially exposed to 
security problems. Network Associates' PGP software, which 
interfaces directly with Microsoft Outlook, has been found 
to be vulnerable to malicious code within an email. Exposed 
systems can be made to execute code of the attacker's 
choice, and because email can be sent from anywhere and to 
anywhere. Tracking down the source could be rather 
difficult. Hotfixes for each of NAI's products are available 
on their website.

<p>You know what a database is, right? Sure you do. Can you 
explain what a relational database is all about? Correctly? 
There's a lot more to database management and development 
than dumping a bunch of records into tables and generating 
reports. Proper design is crucial. Trust me. I've been on 
the receiving end of some lazy programming efforts that 
ignore the foundation of relational databases, and it 
usually results in additional work later.

<p>I like creative use of 404 pages, so sue me. Some of you have complained about the one Chris created for display when you come across a bogus link on the Lockergnome web site, which I don't understand. Would you rather stare at that stupid-looking, uninformative and generally useless one that your browser provides by default? 
<p>Cramsession.com posted some unique ""excuses"" for their site being down for maintenance, and I thought I'd share a few:
<ul><li><p>Roses are red
<br>Our web site is resting
<br>We're fixing the server
<br>While Everquesting
<li>In the interest of research, we're testing to see how long it takes a Network Administrator to get through a people-size maze to the web servers. As soon as he finds them, we'll be back online... Unless the Marketing Minotaur gets him first.
<li>Suicide note found on the web server: ""I've had it. I can't take the heat anymore. You ran me ragged, and what thanks did I get? None. Null. Nothing. I gave and I gave, and you still wanted more I spent every second of my day trying to make you happy, but it was never enough. Always work faster, do more, stay late, work overtime, be more efficient. I was never good enough for you anyway. You deserve better. Signed CPU."" 
<li>You have reached the Cramsession Maintenance Page.
While you are staring at this page, waiting for the website to come back up, (should take about an hour or two) We'd like to offer the following fun activities:
<ol><li>Hold your breath until you see black spots dancing in front of your eyes.
<br><li>Spin around in your chair until you get nauseous. Wheee!
<br><li>Pretend your mouse is a microphone. Dictate a memo into it where you outline your plans for global domination.
<li>Connect the dots!
<br>.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.
<li>Get monitor cleaner so you can wipe ink off of screen from connecting the dots.</ol> 

<li>We apologise for the inconvenience of our missing web site. We're doing something really ""high tech"" and ""important"" behind this ""maintenance"" curtain. We'll be back just as soon as we catch all the gophers.....Again.
<li>HELP! I'm locked in the Server Room. Please send Help! And I'm running out of potato chips, too!</ul>

I've got a few quick Lockergnome-related notes for you today.<p>
First, we'd really like to see you in August. I know that Jake, Chris and Randy have been signing off on their newsletters with those few words, and I'll join them. If you didn't experience <a href=""http://www.gnomedex.com/"" target=""_blank"">Gnomedex</a> last year, you missed, in the words of many industry insiders, ""The show of the year."" It was unlike any other computer conference I've ever attended. Unlike any conference I've attended, period, computer-related or not. While most such conferences are a huge hustle and hassle, Gnomedex was what computing and Lockergnome are all about - sharing useful information, gathering with like-minded enthusiasts, and learning to use your chosen computer to the fullest extent. No hustle. No hassle. No BS. For the minimal cost of <a href=""http://gnomedex.com/registration.php"" target=""_blank"">registration</a>, it would be hard to find a better weekend for geeks and wannabes alike. Add to that the schedule of luminaries presenting and attending and you've got the best deal on the planet for computer users. It's hard to believe we're less than a month away - I really do hope to see you there.<p>
Another Lockergnome innovation has hit the newsstands - err, bookstores. That's right. <a href=""http://applecore.lockergnome.com/"" target=""_blank"">Jake</a> has release a <b>FREE</b> <a href=""http://www.gnometomes.com/"" target=""_blank"">GnomeTome</a> on ""Converting Vinyl LPs to CD."" Who'd have thought there were so many of you out there that are, well, my age and still in possession of those black slabs of aural heaven. I don't know if Jake's just lost his mind, or what, but free? Get outta here. Go ahead - ""Gnome"" our servers. Get you copy while you can. And while you're there, check out some of the other killer e-tip books in the GnomeTomes collection.<p>
Have a great Tuesday.<p><p>

<b>Setting the Home Page in Konqueror</b><p>
Konqueror, while a great browser, has taken a step in the direction of IE. Like IE, Konqueror is really an integrated web <i>and</i> file browser. You can use it equally well to view web pages and files on your system. It's been something of a hot debate whether this is actually the proper use of a browser. In fact, Galeon was written specifically to answer this question - it's a web browser and a web broswer only.<p>
Regardless, it can be a bit annoying to punch the Home button on the Konqueror browser and end up in your /home/<i>user</i> directory. Have no fear, though. It's an easy change to make your actual web home page the home page in Konqueror.<p>
Open Konqueror and select Settings from the toolbar. Select ""Configure Konqueror,"" and leave the default selection of ""File Manager"" as is. In the text box on the right half of the screen, you'll see a tilde in the ""Home URL"" text box. That just tells Konqueror to use the user's home directory as the home URL. Changing this to a web address will set that address as your home page. Select OK to close the window.<p>
Taking it one step further, click on the Home button in your Konqueror browser to open your newly-configured web home page. Then, select ""Window"" and ""Save View Profile, 'Web Browsing.'"" This will futher save the URL and allow your the opportunity to save the window size when the browser opens.<p>
Konqueror is more than just a web browser. But, it's not so tough to make it act like a pure web browser if you just know where to look.<p><p>

<b>Kernel Configuration - Part XII</b><p>
Depending on who you talk to, RAID can stand for ""Redundant Array of Independent Discs"" or ""Redundant Array of Inexpensive Discs."" No matter. They both point to the same theory and practice in Linux; data storage redundancy. That's today's kernel configuration section - Multi-Device Support.<p>
Let's talk first about the principles behind a RAID setup. RAID uses multiple discs for speed, increased data storage, or data redundancy. Fundamentally, there are 5 levels of RAID in Linux; Linear, RAID-0, RAID-1, RAID-4, and RAID-5.<p>
Linear RAID uses two or more discs, appending data from one to another. In other words, when disc 1 is full, disc 2 steps in to store data. There is no redundancy in Linear RAID - only an increase in storage capacity. Further, there's no marked increase in data access speed because you're accessing one drive in the RAID array at a time.<p>
RAID-0 ""stripes"" data across the RAID drives. Some data will be written to the first drive, some to the second, etc. Like Linear RAID, RAID-0 provides no redundancy. Because the data has been written in parallel across the drives, not all data exists on all drives. Lose a drive and your data is gone. RAID-0 will, however, decrease data access time. Your system will run more quickly.<p>
RAID-1, unlike Linear and RAID-0, <i>does</i> provide data redundancy. This is the first level in which data is ""mirrored"" across the drives in the RAID array. All data that exists on one drive exists on all the others. RAID-1 requires at least two drives and they should be of equal size, otherwise, your overall RAID array will be the size of the smallest drive. Performance with RAID-1 can actually be slower than with a single drive or RAID-0, as all the data is written across multiple discs.<p>
RAID-4 is, for the most part, pretty useless. It reserves one disc for <a href=""http://wombat.doc.ic.ac.uk/foldoc/foldoc.cgi?query=parity"" target=""_blank"">parity</a> information while striping the data across the others. This is much like Linear mode, with an additional disc thrown in for parity data. Parity data <i>can</i> be used to reconstruct and retrieve the data on the other drives, but this really isn't a redundant method of data storage. Consequently, RAID-4 is probably the least used of the RAID schemes.<p>
RAID-5 is designed for 3 or more discs and provides both redundancy and speed. Like RAID-4, RAID-5 pays close attention to parity data. However, rather than reserving a device in the RAID array for this data, it's written across the array. Because the parity data is written across the array, data recovery can be accomplished fairly quickly. In fact, using a ""spare disc"" configuration will allow RAID-5 to reconstruct the data to the spare disc immediately after the failure of a drive. Because of it's increased speed and redundancy, RAID-5 is probably the most common setup for multiple storage devices.<p>
With all that in mind, you'll need to make a choice in your kernel configuration. Do you have mutliple drives of the same size that you'd like to configure as a RAID array? The Multi-Device Support section of the kernel configuration will allow you to do this. In fact, you'll be able to set the RAID level, as well. Again, evaluate your needs and select the appropriate option.<p>
Tomorrow, it's on to networking options in your kernel configuration.<p><p>

Alberta, and to a lesser extent some of the other Western provinces, is
definitely not happy with the current arrangement.  Some of this has to
do with the strange way the Canadian government is structured.  When I
was last up in Alberta (a month ago), the newspapers were reporting
something like 70% of Albertans favor separating from Canada, and over
several distinct issues.
The problem is basically that while Alberta is an economic powerhouse
that is propping up the weaker economies of the Eastern provinces, their
interests are openly and unapologetically ignored by the government in
Ottawa.  While Alberta sends something like twice the tax dollars to
Ottawa per capita of the average Canadian, they only have token
representation in the federal government.  While I'm not clear on
exactly how the government works up there, representation is not
entirely based on population, and it works out that some eastern
provinces with populations smaller than the city of Calgary alone have
substantially more representatives in the legislature than the entire
province of Alberta.  
The long and the short of it is that the eastern provinces use Alberta
as a personal ATM machine for their social programs while not even so
much as throwing Alberta a bone, and are able to do so because even the
sparsely populated eastern provinces can out-vote Alberta despite having
fewer people.  Or something like that.  The Canadian government is less
restricted than the US government, so they can do strange things, like
having restrictive regulations that only apply to certain provinces,
Alberta being on the receiving end of many such obscenities.  It is
essentially a much worse version of what is happening in the
inter-mountain West of the US.  Unlike the US case though, the rest of
Canada would really be hurting if they weren't receiving all those tax
dollars from Alberta.  OTOH, Alberta would probably thrive.
I have friends in Alberta, and visit occasionally, but I'm not totally
clear on everything that goes on in that country, due to my partial
unfamiliarity with how the government works up there, so I'm a little
fuzzy on some of the details.  What I do know is that on average the
Albertans are quite unhappy with their current position in Canada and
the sentiment has been getting worse over the years.

 Endeavors Technology and RSA Security Form Strategic Partnership to 
 Enhance SSL Performance in Secure, Enterprise-Scalable P2P Computing
Endeavors Technology and RSA Security combine their respective peer-to-peer Magi Enterprise 
Web collaboration and RSA BSAFE software for SSL users to instantly extend security and improve performance
of 
desktop and corporate data sharing, and Web interaction between workgroups inside and across corporations.
Irvine (CA) and Cambridge (UK), September 12, 2002 - Secure web collaboration software leader Endeavors
Technology, Inc. today
announced a technology sharing and marketing agreement with RSA Security Inc. the most trusted name in
e-security. This strategic
partnership is aimed at extending the security and improving the performance of the standard SSL security
protocol used by every e-based
desktop, laptop and server. 
Under the terms of the agreement, RSA Security's trusted security tools are embedded into Endeavors
Technology's award-winning Magi
Enterprise software product. The combined solution enables IT managers and users to simply extend security and
encryption to every
Magi-enabled device for the direct device-to-device sharing and interaction of corporate data and workflow
between workgroups within and
beyond the enterprise.
Secure collaboration between desktops and corporate systems calls for enterprises to build complex and costly
network infrastructures. This
combination of technologies from the two companies eliminates both overheads, and also the need for specific
security tools for each desktop
application such as Microsoft Project. With Magi's secure RSA Security-based peer environment, collaboration
can now be rapidly, easily and
securely extended across all devices and company firewalls, and workgroups can interact with colleagues,
partners and clients without concern
in compromising corporate information. This brings true Internet scaling to corporations needing to interact
highly securely with strong
encryption and authentication across firewalls.
""In these challenging times, there can be no compromise in safeguarding corporate data and knowledge,"" says
Bernard Hulme, chairman and
CEO of Endeavors Technology. ""Embedding RSA Security encryption software into Magi products provides IT
managers with added
assurance, speed and cost savings, and a proven security net to accelerate the deployment of business-centric
peer-to-peer computing""
Endeavors Technology joins the RSA Secured Partner Program. The program is designed to ensure complete
interoperability between
partner products and RSA Security's solutions including RSA SecurID two-factor authentication, RSA
ClearTrust Web access
management, RSA BSAFE encryption and RSA Keon digital certificate management.
The strategic partnership paves the way for Magi Enterprise to bear the RSA Secured brand on product packaging
and advertising, be listed in
RSA Secured Partner Solutions directories, and have RSA Security's out-of-the-box, certified interoperability.
It will also lead to joint
marketing and promotional activities between the two firms, mutual field sales engagement opportunities on
joint accounts, and 24x7 worldwide
business continuity support.
""Endeavors Technology is taking a leadership role by providing the highest-level of security in its enterprise
products and streamlining the
deployment process for IT managers,"" says Stuart Cohen, director of partner development at RSA Security. ""By
combining our products,
enterprise customers have a solution that provides encryption and authentication across firewalls.""

Get Sexier, Keep Husbands, Mayor Tells Wives
Wed Sep 4, 9:14 AM ET
MISSAGLIA, Italy (Reuters) - Husband's eyes wandering? Make yourself sexier.
At least that's the solution proposed by an Italian mayor -- and a woman
mayor at that.
Wives in the northern town of Missaglia had complained to mayor Marta
Casiraghi about a young woman who sunbathed topless on her terrace.
They complained that the men in the town of some 7,000 people were spending
too much time ogling, so they asked Casiraghi to order the woman to put her
clothes back on.
But the mayor, far from sympathizing, told the wives to get sexy if they
wanted to keep their men. ""The girl was very pretty and was soaking up some
sun. Topless sunbathing is largely tolerated and widespread nowadays.
There's nothing we can do,"" Casiraghi told Il Nuovo, a web-based newspaper.
""Instead, I'd advise the wives to play their rival at her own game -- make
themselves more beautiful.""",ham

That's very perceptive of you.  Many people are not so willing to
accept their personal reality as skewed by their neuro-physiology.  A
great many popular con games exist by exploiting the perceptions of
these states.
Another oft-exploited neuro-plausibility: The brain is a pretty darn
fine analog associative computer, so it could be the neurochemical
events during the dream have associated themselves with some inner or
external cue to mentally _recreate_ the state-perception like the
predictable tone on striking a bell.

Razor folks: is -lm documented anywhere?   BTW, I notice all my *.conf

Yeah, that'd be cool -- much appreciated!   comparing text classifiers
like spam filters, without tracking FPs, is not good.   After all, ""cat >

say 90%, you'd never know it was a bad thing to do ;)

And yet STILL noone is out there creating _public domain_ content. Is there
even one person out there can can even begin to talk without being a
complete hypocrite? And no the ""open source"" people cant talk either, the
GPL aint even close. I know I cant talk.
If the creator didnt say you could have it without paying, it's theft, so
simple, hell that's even in all the major holy books.
Fair use needs to be clarified a bit and then I hope they start locking
people up. How else do i ever have hope of finding a job working for someone
that makes things people are supposed to ... *drumroll* pay for.

*Political spam on your cell phone?*
By Lisa M. Bowman <mailto:lisa.bowman@cnet.com>

*In a decision that treats text messaging on mobile phones essentially 
the same as bumper stickers, the Federal Election Commission has 
declared that senders of text-based political ads don't have to disclose 
who funded them.*
In an advisory opinion issued Thursday, the FEC also suggested such 
messages include either a phone number or Web site link, so people could 
easily learn who paid for the message. However, the additional 
information won't be required.
The opinion could encourage the adoption of text-based political ads, as 
campaign experts look for new technological ways to sway voters. At the 
same time, opponents of the plan fear it could lead to anonymous 
political spam.
Target Wireless, a small New Jersey-based wireless media company, had 
asked the FEC for an opinion on the matter, saying that requiring 
financial disclosures on short messaging service (SMS) mailings would 
use up too much of the 160 character-maximum.
Political messages on bumper stickers and buttons are also exempt from 
the financial disclosure requirement. Target Wireless' petition was 
supported by the National Republican Senatorial Committee, the Cellular 
Telecommunications and Internet Association, and some advertising trade 
groups.
FEC spokesman Bob Biersack said the opinion was in keeping with the 
commission's policy not to meddle with new technology that has the 
potential to reach more voters.
""We have tried very hard not to get in the way--particularly before 
everyone understands how the technology is going to work,"" he said.
Opponents of the plan have worried the exemption might encourage spam or 
allow senders to blast people with mass amounts of negative political 
messages while remaining anonymous.
Biersack said the FEC can revisit the issue if those problems surface.
Target Wireless President Craig Krueger characterized the opinion as 
""good for America.""
""It will allow people to receive more communication from those running 
for office,"" he said. ""We have free speech on our side.""",ham

THE NEXT WORLD ORDER

The Bush Administration may have a brand-new doctrine of power.
Issue of 2002-04-01
Posted 2002-03-25
When there is a change of command-and not just in government-the new people
often persuade themselves that the old people were much worse than anyone
suspected. This feeling seems especially intense in the Bush
Administration, perhaps because Bill Clinton has been bracketed by a
father-son team. It's easy for people in the Administration to believe
that, after an unfortunate eight-year interlude, the Bush family has
resumed its governance-and about time, too.
The Bush Administration's sense that the Clinton years were a waste, or
worse, is strongest in the realms of foreign policy and military affairs.
Republicans tend to regard Democrats as untrustworthy in defense and
foreign policy, anyway, in ways that coincide with what people think of as
Clinton's weak points: an eagerness to please, a lack of discipline.
Condoleezza Rice, Bush's national-security adviser, wrote an article in
Foreign Affairs two years ago in which she contemptuously accused Clinton
of ""an extraordinary neglect of the fiduciary responsibilities of the
commander in chief."" Most of the top figures in foreign affairs in this
Administration also served under the President's father. They took office
last year, after what they regard as eight years of small-time flyswatting
by Clinton, thinking that they were picking up where they'd left off.
Not long ago, I had lunch with-sorry!-a senior Administration
foreign-policy official, at a restaurant in Washington called the Oval
Room. Early in the lunch, he handed me a twenty-seven- page report, whose
cover bore the seal of the Department of Defense, an outline map of the
world, and these words:
Defense Strategy for the 1990s:
The Regional Defense Strategy
Secretary of Defense
Dick Cheney
January 1993
One of the difficulties of working at the highest level of government is
communicating its drama. Actors, professional athletes, and even elected
politicians train for years, go through a great winnowing, and then perform
publicly. People who have titles like Deputy Assistant Secretary of Defense
are just as ambitious and competitive, have worked just as long and hard,
and are often playing for even higher stakes-but what they do all day is go
to meetings and write memos and prepare briefings. How, possibly, to
explain that some of the documents, including the report that the senior
official handed me, which was physically indistinguishable from a
high-school term paper, represent the government version of playing
Carnegie Hall?
After the fall of the Berlin Wall, Dick Cheney, then the Secretary of
Defense, set up a ""shop,"" as they say, to think about American foreign
policy after the Cold War, at the grand strategic level. The project, whose
existence was kept quiet, included people who are now back in the game, at
a higher level: among them, Paul Wolfowitz, the Deputy Secretary of
Defense; Lewis Libby, Cheney's chief of staff; and Eric Edelman, a senior
foreign-policy adviser to Cheney-generally speaking, a cohesive group of
conservatives who regard themselves as bigger-thinking, tougher-minded, and
intellectually bolder than most other people in Washington. (Donald
Rumsfeld, the Secretary of Defense, shares these characteristics, and has
been closely associated with Cheney for more than thirty years.) Colin
Powell, then the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, mounted a
competing, and presumably more ideologically moderate, effort to reimagine
American foreign policy and defense. A date was set-May 21, 1990-on which
each team would brief Cheney for an hour; Cheney would then brief President
Bush, after which Bush would make a foreign-policy address unveiling the
new grand strategy.
Everybody worked for months on the ""five-twenty-one brief,"" with a sense
that the shape of the post-Cold War world was at stake. When Wolfowitz and
Powell arrived at Cheney's office on May 21st, Wolfowitz went first, but
his briefing lasted far beyond the allotted hour, and Cheney (a hawk who,
perhaps, liked what he was hearing) did not call time on him. Powell didn't
get to present his alternate version of the future of the United States in
the world until a couple of weeks later. Cheney briefed President Bush,
using material mostly from Wolfowitz, and Bush prepared his major
foreign-policy address. But he delivered it on August 2, 1990, the day that
Iraq invaded Kuwait, so nobody noticed.
The team kept working. In 1992, the Times got its hands on a version of the
material, and published a front-page story saying that the Pentagon
envisioned a future in which the United States could, and should, prevent
any other nation or alliance from becoming a great power. A few weeks of
controversy ensued about the Bush Administration's hawks being
""unilateral""-controversy that Cheney's people put an end to with denials
and the counter-leak of an edited, softer version of the same material.
As it became apparent that Bush was going to lose to Clinton, the Cheney
team's efforts took on the quality of a parting shot. The report that the
senior official handed me at lunch had been issued only a few days before
Clinton took office. It is a somewhat bland, opaque document-a ""scrubbed,""
meaning unclassified, version of something more candid-but it contained the
essential ideas of ""shaping,"" rather than reacting to, the rest of the
world, and of preventing the rise of other superpowers. Its tone is one of
skepticism about diplomatic partnerships. A more forthright version of the
same ideas can be found in a short book titled ""From Containment to Global
Leadership?,"" which Zalmay Khalilzad, who joined Cheney's team in 1991 and
is now special envoy to Afghanistan, published a couple of years into the
Clinton Administration, when he was out of government. It recommends that
the United States ""preclude the rise of another global rival for the
indefinite future."" Khalilzad writes, ""It is a vital U.S. interest to
preclude such a development-i.e., to be willing to use force if necessary
for the purpose.""
When George W. Bush was campaigning for President, he and the people around
him didn't seem to be proposing a great doctrinal shift, along the lines of
the policy of containment of the Soviet Union's sphere of influence which
the United States maintained during the Cold War. In his first major
foreign-policy speech, delivered in November of 1999, Bush declared that ""a
President must be a clear-eyed realist,"" a formulation that seems to
connote an absence of world-remaking ambition. ""Realism"" is exactly the
foreign-policy doctrine that Cheney's Pentagon team rejected, partly
because it posits the impossibility of any one country's ever dominating
world affairs for any length of time.
One gets many reminders in Washington these days of how much the terrorist
attacks of September 11th have changed official foreign-policy thinking.
Any chief executive, of either party, would probably have done what Bush
has done so far-made war on the Taliban and Al Qaeda and enhanced domestic
security. It is only now, six months after the attacks, that we are truly
entering the realm of Presidential choice, and all indications are that
Bush is going to use September 11th as the occasion to launch a new,
aggressive American foreign policy that would represent a broad change in
direction rather than a specific war on terrorism. All his rhetoric,
especially in the two addresses he has given to joint sessions of Congress
since September 11th, and all the information about his state of mind which
his aides have leaked, indicate that he sees this as the nation's moment of
destiny-a perception that the people around him seem to be encouraging,
because it enhances Bush's stature and opens the way to more assertive
policymaking.
Inside government, the reason September 11th appears to have been ""a
transformative moment,"" as the senior official I had lunch with put it, is
not so much that it revealed the existence of a threat of which officials
had previously been unaware as that it drastically reduced the American
public's usual resistance to American military involvement overseas, at
least for a while. The Clinton Administration, beginning with the ""Black
Hawk Down"" operation in Mogadishu, during its first year, operated on the
conviction that Americans were highly averse to casualties; the all-bombing
Kosovo operation, in Clinton's next-to-last year, was the ideal foreign
military adventure. Now that the United States has been attacked, the
options are much broader. The senior official approvingly mentioned a 1999
study of casualty aversion by the Triangle Institute for Security Studies,
which argued that the ""mass public"" is much less casualty-averse than the
military or the civilian lite believes; for example, the study showed that
the public would tolerate thirty thousand deaths in a military operation to
prevent Iraq from acquiring weapons of mass destruction. (The American
death total in the Vietnam War was about fifty-eight thousand.) September
11th presumably reduced casualty aversion even further.
Recently, I went to the White House to interview Condoleezza Rice. Rice's
Foreign Affairs article from 2000 begins with this declaration: ""The United
States has found it exceedingly difficult to define its 'national interest'
in the absence of Soviet power."" I asked her whether that is still the
case. ""I think the difficulty has passed in defining a role,"" she said
immediately. ""I think September 11th was one of those great earthquakes
that clarify and sharpen. Events are in much sharper relief."" Like Bush,
she said that opposing terrorism and preventing the accumulation of weapons
of mass destruction ""in the hands of irresponsible states"" now define the
national interest. (The latter goal, by the way, is new-in Bush's speech to
Congress on September 20th, America's sole grand purpose was ending
terrorism.) We talked in her West Wing office; its tall windows face the
part of the White House grounds where television reporters do their
standups. In her bearing, Rice seemed less crisply military than she does
in public. She looked a little tired, but she was projecting a kind of
missionary calm, rather than belligerence.
In the Foreign Affairs article, Rice came across as a classic realist,
putting forth ""the notions of power politics, great powers, and power
balances"" as the proper central concerns of the United States. Now she
sounded as if she had moved closer to the one-power idea that Cheney's
Pentagon team proposed ten years ago-or, at least, to the idea that the
other great powers are now in harmony with the United States, because of
the terrorist attacks, and can be induced to remain so. ""Theoretically, the
realists would predict that when you have a great power like the United
States it would not be long before you had other great powers rising to
challenge it or trying to balance against it,"" Rice said. ""And I think what
you're seeing is that there's at least a predilection this time to move to
productive and coperative relations with the United States, rather than to
try to balance the United States. I actually think that statecraft matters
in how it all comes out. It's not all foreordained.""
Rice said that she had called together the senior staff people of the
National Security Council and asked them to think seriously about ""how do
you capitalize on these opportunities"" to fundamentally change American
doctrine, and the shape of the world, in the wake of September 11th. ""I
really think this period is analogous to 1945 to 1947,"" she said-that is,
the period when the containment doctrine took shape-""in that the events so
clearly demonstrated that there is a big global threat, and that it's a big
global threat to a lot of countries that you would not have normally
thought of as being in the coalition. That has started shifting the
tectonic plates in international politics. And it's important to try to
seize on that and position American interests and institutions and all of
that before they harden again.""
The National Security Council is legally required to produce an annual
document called the National Security Strategy, stating the over-all goals
of American policy-another government report whose importance is great but
not obvious. The Bush Administration did not produce one last year, as the
Clinton Administration did not in its first year. Rice said that she is
working on the report now.
""There are two ways to handle this document,"" she told me. ""One is to do it
in a kind of minimalist way and just get it out. But it's our view that,
since this is going to be the first one for the Bush Administration, it's
important. An awful lot has happened since we started this process, prior
to 9/11. I can't give you a certain date when it's going to be out, but I
would think sometime this spring. And it's important that it be a real
statement of what the Bush Administration sees as the strategic direction
that it's going.""
It seems clear already that Rice will set forth the hope of a more dominant
American role in the world than she might have a couple of years ago. Some
questions that don't appear to be settled yet, but are obviously being
asked, are how much the United States is willing to operate alone in
foreign affairs, and how much change it is willing to try to engender
inside other countries-and to what end, and with what means. The leak a
couple of weeks ago of a new American nuclear posture, adding offensive
capability against ""rogue states,"" departed from decades of official
adherence to a purely defensive position, and was just one indication of
the scope of the reconsideration that is going on. Is the United States now
in a position to be redrawing regional maps, especially in the Middle East,
and replacing governments by force? Nobody thought that the Bush
Administration would be thinking in such ambitious terms, but plainly it
is, and with the internal debate to the right of where it was only a few
months ago.
Just before the 2000 election, a Republican foreign-policy figure suggested
to me that a good indication of a Bush Administration's direction in
foreign affairs would be who got a higher-ranking job, Paul Wolfowitz or
Richard Haass. Haass is another veteran of the first Bush Administration,
and an intellectual like Wolfowitz, but much more moderate. In 1997, he
published a book titled ""The Reluctant Sheriff,"" in which he poked a little
fun at Wolfowitz's famous strategy briefing of the early nineties (he
called it the ""Pentagon Paper"") and disagreed with its idea that the United
States should try to be the world's only great power over the long term.
""For better or worse, such a goal is beyond our reach,"" Haass wrote. ""It
simply is not doable."" Elsewhere in the book, he disagreed with another of
the Wolfowitz team's main ideas, that of the United States expanding the
""democratic zone of peace"": ""Primacy is not to be confused with hegemony.
The United States cannot compel others to become more democratic."" Haass
argued that the United States is becoming less dominant in the world, not
more, and suggested ""a revival of what might be called traditional
great-power politics.""
Wolfowitz got a higher-ranking job than Haass: he is Deputy Secretary of
Defense, and Haass is Director of Policy Planning for the State Department-
in effect, Colin Powell's big-think guy. Recently, I went to see him in his
office at the State Department. On the wall of his waiting room was an
array of photographs of every past director of the policy-planning staff,
beginning with George Kennan, the father of the containment doctrine and
the first holder of the office that Haass now occupies.
It's another indication of the way things are moving in Washington that
Haass seems to have become more hawkish. I mentioned the title of his book.
""Using the word 'reluctant' was itself reflective of a period when foreign
policy seemed secondary, and sacrificing for foreign policy was a hard case
to make,"" he said. ""It was written when Bill Clinton was saying, 'It's the
economy, stupid'-not 'It's the world, stupid.' Two things are very
different now. One, the President has a much easier time making the case
that foreign policy matters. Second, at the top of the national-security
charts is this notion of weapons of mass destruction and terrorism.""
I asked Haass whether there is a doctrine emerging that is as broad as
Kennan's containment. ""I think there is,"" he said. ""What you're seeing from
this Administration is the emergence of a new principle or body of
ideas-I'm not sure it constitutes a doctrine-about what you might call the
limits of sovereignty. Sovereignty entails obligations. One is not to
massacre your own people. Another is not to support terrorism in any way.
If a government fails to meet these obligations, then it forfeits some of
the normal advantages of sovereignty, including the right to be left alone
inside your own territory. Other governments, including the United States,
gain the right to intervene. In the case of terrorism, this can even lead
to a right of preventive, or peremptory, self-defense. You essentially can
act in anticipation if you have grounds to think it's a question of when,
and not if, you're going to be attacked.""
Clearly, Haass was thinking of Iraq. ""I don't think the American public
needs a lot of persuading about the evil that is Saddam Hussein,"" he said.
""Also, I'd fully expect the President and his chief lieutenants to make the
case. Public opinion can be changed. We'd be able to make the case that
this isn't a discretionary action but one done in self-defense.""
On the larger issue of the American role in the world, Haass was still
maintaining some distance from the hawks. He had made a speech not long
before called ""Imperial America,"" but he told me that there is a big
difference between imperial and imperialist. ""I just think that we have to
be a little bit careful,"" he said. ""Great as our advantages are, there are
still limits. We have to have allies. We can't impose our ideas on
everyone. We don't want to be fighting wars alone, so we need others to
join us. American leadership, yes; but not American unilateralism. It has
to be multilateral. We can't win the war against terror alone. We can't
send forces everywhere. It really does have to be a collaborative endeavor.""
He stopped for a moment. ""Is there a successor idea to containment? I think
there is,"" he said. ""It is the idea of integration. The goal of U.S.
foreign policy should be to persuade the other major powers to sign on to
certain key ideas as to how the world should operate: opposition to
terrorism and weapons of mass destruction, support for free trade,
democracy, markets. Integration is about locking them into these policies
and then building institutions that lock them in even more.""
The first, but by no means the last, obvious manifestation of a new
American foreign policy will be the effort to remove Saddam Hussein. What
the United States does in an Iraq operation will very likely dwarf what's
been done so far in Afghanistan, both in terms of the scale of the
operation itself and in terms of its aftermath.
Several weeks ago, Ahmad Chalabi, the head of the Iraqi National Congress,
the Iraqi opposition party, came through Washington with an entourage of
his aides. Chalabi went to the State Department and the White House to ask,
evidently successfully, for more American funding. His main public event
was a panel discussion at the American Enterprise Institute. Chalabi's
leading supporter in town, Richard Perle, the prominent hawk and former
Defense Department official, acted as moderator. Smiling and supremely
confident, Perle opened the discussion by saying, ""Evidence is mounting
that the Administration is looking very carefully at strategies for dealing
with Saddam Hussein."" The war on terrorism, he said, will not be complete
""until Saddam is successfully dealt with. And that means replacing his
regime. . . . That action will be taken, I have no doubt.""
Chalabi, who lives in London, is a charming, suave middle-aged man with a
twinkle in his eye. He was dressed in a double-breasted pin-striped suit
and a striped shirt with a white spread collar. Although he and his
supporters argue that the Iraqi National Congress, with sufficient American
support, can defeat Saddam just as the Northern Alliance defeated the
Taliban in Afghanistan, this view hasn't won over most people in
Washington. It isn't just that Chalabi doesn't look the part of a rebel
military leader (""He could fight you for the last petit four on the tray
over tea at the Savoy, but that's about it,"" one skeptical former Pentagon
official told me), or that he isn't in Iraq. It's also that Saddam's
military is perhaps ten times the size that the Taliban's was, and has been
quite successful at putting down revolts over the last decade. The United
States left Iraq in 1991 believing that Saddam might soon fall to an
internal rebellion; Chalabi's supporters believe that Saddam is much weaker
now, and that even signs that a serious operation was in the offing could
finish him off. But non-true believers seem to be coming around to the idea
that a military operation against Saddam would mean the deployment of
anywhere from a hundred thousand to three hundred thousand American ground
troops.
Kenneth Pollack, a former C.I.A. analyst who was the National Security
Council's staff expert on Iraq during the last years of the Clinton
Administration, recently caused a stir in the foreign-policy world by
publishing an article in Foreign Affairs calling for war against Saddam.
This was noteworthy because three years ago Pollack and two co-authors
published an article, also in Foreign Affairs, arguing that the Iraqi
National Congress was incapable of defeating Saddam. Pollack still doesn't
think Chalabi can do the job. He believes that it would require a
substantial American ground, air, and sea force, closer in size to the one
we used in Kuwait in 1990-91 than to the one we are using now in
Afghanistan.
Pollack, who is trim, quick, and crisp, is obviously a man who has given a
briefing or two in his day. When I went to see him at his office in
Washington, with a little encouragement he got out from behind his desk and
walked over to his office wall, where three maps of the Middle East were
hanging. ""The only way to do it is a full-scale invasion,"" he said, using a
pen as a pointer. ""We're talking about two grand corps, two to three
hundred thousand people altogether. The population is here, in the
Tigris-Euphrates valley."" He pointed to the area between Baghdad and Basra.
""Ideally, you'd have the Saudis on board."" He pointed to the Prince Sultan
airbase, near Riyadh. ""You could make Kuwait the base, but it's much easier
in Saudi. You need to take western Iraq and southern Iraq""-pointing
again-""because otherwise they'll fire Scuds at Israel and at the Saudi oil
fields. You probably want to prevent Iraq from blowing up its own oil
fields, so troops have to occupy them. And you need troops to defend the
Kurds in northern Iraq."" Point, point. ""You go in as hard as you can, as
fast as you can."" He slapped his hand on the top of his desk. ""You get the
enemy to divide his forces, by threatening him in two places at once."" His
hand hit the desk again, hard. ""Then you crush him."" Smack.
That would be a reverberating blow. The United States has already removed
the government of one country, Afghanistan, the new government is obviously
shaky, and American military operations there are not completed. Pakistan,
which before September 11th clearly met the new test of national
unacceptability (it both harbors terrorists and has weapons of mass
destruction), will also require long-term attention, since the country is
not wholly under the control of the government, as the murder of Daniel
Pearl demonstrated, and even parts of the government, like the intelligence
service, may not be entirely under the control of the President. In Iraq,
if America invades and brings down Saddam, a new government must be
established-an enormous long-term task in a country where there is no
obvious, plausible new leader. The prospective Iraq operation has drawn
strong objections from the neighboring nations, one of which, Russia, is a
nuclear superpower. An invasion would have a huge effect on the internal
affairs of all the biggest Middle Eastern nations: Iran, Turkey, Saudi
Arabia, and even Egypt. Events have forced the Administration to become
directly involved in the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, as it hadn't wanted
to do. So it's really the entire region that is in play, in much the way
that Europe was immediately after the Second World War.
In September, Bush rejected Paul Wolfowitz's recommendation of immediate
moves against Iraq. That the President seems to have changed his mind is an
indication, in part, of the bureaucratic skill of the Administration's
conservatives. ""These guys are relentless,"" one former official, who is
close to the high command at the State Department, told me. ""Resistance is
futile."" The conservatives' other weapon, besides relentlessness, is
intellectualism. Colin Powell tends to think case by case, and since
September 11th the conservatives have outflanked him by producing at least
the beginning of a coherent, hawkish world view whose acceptance
practically requires invading Iraq. If the United States applies the
doctrines of Cheney's old Pentagon team, ""shaping"" and expanding ""the zone
of democracy,"" the implications would extend far beyond that one operation.
The outside experts on the Middle East who have the most credibility with
the Administration seem to be Bernard Lewis, of Princeton, and Fouad Ajami,
of the Johns Hopkins School of Advanced International Studies, both of whom
see the Arab Middle East as a region in need of radical remediation. Lewis
was invited to the White House in December to brief the senior
foreign-policy staff. ""One point he made is, Look, in that part of the
world, nothing matters more than resolute will and force,"" the senior
official I had lunch with told me-in other words, the United States needn't
proceed gingerly for fear of inflaming the ""Arab street,"" as long as it is
prepared to be strong. The senior official also recommended as interesting
thinkers on the Middle East Charles Hill, of Yale, who in a recent essay
declared, ""Every regime of the Arab-Islamic world has proved a failure,""
and Reuel Marc Gerecht, of the American Enterprise Institute, who published
an article in The Weekly Standard about the need for a change of regime in
Iran and Syria. (Those goals, Gerecht told me when we spoke, could be
accomplished through pressure short of an invasion.)
Several people I spoke with predicted that most, or even all, of the
nations that loudly oppose an invasion of Iraq would privately cheer it on,
if they felt certain that this time the Americans were really going to
finish the job. One purpose of Vice-President Cheney's recent diplomatic
tour of the region was to offer assurances on that matter, while gamely
absorbing all the public criticism of an Iraq operation. In any event, the
Administration appears to be committed to acting forcefully in advance of
the world's approval. When I spoke to Condoleezza Rice, she said that the
United States should assemble ""coalitions of the willing"" to support its
actions, rather than feel it has to work within the existing infrastructure
of international treaties and organizations. An invasion of Iraq would test
that policy in more ways than one: the Administration would be betting that
it can continue to eliminate Al Qaeda cells in countries that publicly
opposed the Iraq operation.
When the Administration submitted its budget earlier this year, it asked
for a forty-eight-billion-dollar increase in defense spending for fiscal
2003, which begins in October, 2002. Much of that sum would go to improve
military pay and benefits, but ten billion dollars of it is designated as
an unspecified contingency fund for further operations in the war on
terrorism. That's probably at least the initial funding for an invasion of
Iraq.
This spring, the Administration will be talking to other countries about
the invasion, trying to secure basing and overflight privileges, while Bush
builds up a rhetorical case for it by giving speeches about the
unacceptability of developing weapons of mass destruction. A drama
involving weapons inspections in Iraq will play itself out over the spring
and summer, and will end with the United States declaring that the terms
that Saddam offers for the inspections, involving delays and restrictions,
are unacceptable. Then, probably in the late summer or early fall, the
enormous troop positioning, which will take months, will begin. The
Administration obviously feels confident that the United States can
effectively parry whatever aggressive actions Saddam takes during the troop
buildup, and hopes that its moves will destabilize Iraq enough to cause the
Republican Guard, the military key to the country, to turn against Saddam
and topple him on its own. But the chain of events leading inexorably to a
full-scale American invasion, if it hasn't already begun, evidently will
begin soon.
Lewis (Scooter) Libby, who was the principal drafter of Cheney's
future-of-the-world documents during the first Bush Administration, now
works in an office in the Old Executive Office Building, overlooking the
West Wing, where he has a second, smaller office. A packet of
public-relations material prompted by the recent paperback publication of
his 1996 novel, ""The Apprentice,"" quotes the Times' calling him ""Dick
Cheney's Dick Cheney,"" which seems like an apt description: he appears
absolutely sure of himself, and, whether by coincidence or as a result of
the influence of his boss, speaks in a tough, confidential, gravelly
rumble. Like Condoleezza Rice and Bush himself, he gives the impression of
having calmly accepted the idea that the project of war and reconstruction
which the Administration has now taken on may be a little exhausting for
those charged with carrying it out but is unquestionably right, the only
truly prudent course.
When I went to see Libby, not long ago, I asked him whether, before
September 11th, American policy toward terrorism should have been
different. He went to his desk and got out a large black loose-leaf binder,
filled with typewritten sheets interspersed with foldout maps of the Middle
East. He looked through it for a long minute, formulating his answer.
""Let us stack it up,"" he said at last. ""Somalia, 1993; 1994, the discovery
of the Al Qaeda-related plot in the Philippines; 1993, the World Trade
Center, first bombing; 1993, the attempt to assassinate President Bush,
former President Bush, and the lack of response to that, the lack of a
serious response to that; 1995, the Riyadh bombing; 1996, the Khobar
bombing; 1998, the Kenyan embassy bombing and the Tanzanian embassy
bombing; 1999, the plot to launch millennium attacks; 2000, the bombing of
the Cole. Throughout this period, infractions on inspections by the Iraqis,
and eventually the withdrawal of the entire inspection regime; and the
failure to respond significantly to Iraqi incursions in the Kurdish areas.
No one would say these challenges posed easy problems, but if you take that
long list and you ask, 'Did we respond in a way which discouraged people
from supporting terrorist activities, or activities clearly against our
interests? Did we help to shape the environment in a way which discouraged
further aggressions against U.S. interests?,' many observers conclude no,
and ask whether it was then easier for someone like Osama bin Laden to rise
up and say credibly, 'The Americans don't have the stomach to defend
themselves. They won't take casualties to defend their interests. They are
morally weak.' ""
Libby insisted that the American response to September 11th has not been
standard or foreordained. ""Look at what the President has done in
Afghanistan,"" he said, ""and look at his speech to the joint session of
Congress""-meaning the State of the Union Message, in January. ""He made it
clear that it's an important area. He made it clear that we believe in
expanding the zone of democracy even in this difficult part of the world.
He made it clear that we stand by our friends and defend our interests. And
he had the courage to identify those states which present a problem, and to
begin to build consensus for action that would need to be taken if there is
not a change of behavior on their part. Take the Afghan case, for example.
There are many other courses that the President could have taken. He could
have waited for juridical proof before we responded. He could have engaged
in long negotiations with the Taliban. He could have failed to seek a new
relationship with Pakistan, based on its past nuclear tests, or been so
afraid of weakening Pakistan that we didn't seek its help. This list could
go on to twice or three times the length I've mentioned so far. But,
instead, the President saw an opportunity to refashion relations while
standing up for our interests. The problem is complex, and we don't know
yet how it will end, but we have opened new prospects for relations not
only with Afghanistan, as important as it was as a threat, but with the
states of Central Asia, Pakistan, Russia, and, as it may develop, with the
states of Southwest Asia more generally.""
We moved on to Iraq, and the question of what makes Saddam Hussein
unacceptable, in the Administration's eyes. ""The issue is not inspections,""
Libby said. ""The issue is the Iraqis' promise not to have weapons of mass
destruction, their promise to recognize the boundaries of Kuwait, their
promise not to threaten other countries, and other promises that they made
in '91, and a number of U.N. resolutions, including all the other problems
I listed. Whether it was wise or not-and that is the subject of debate-Iraq
was given a second chance to abide by international norms. It failed to
take that chance then, and annually for the next ten years.""
""What's your level of confidence,"" I asked him, ""that the current regime
will, in fact, change its behavior in a way that you will be satisfied by?""
He ran his hand over his face and then gave me a direct gaze and spoke
slowly and deliberately. ""There is no basis in Iraq's past behavior to have
confidence in good-faith efforts on their part to change their behavior.""

I wonder if it is possible to reverse-engineer the Reed-Solomon 
error-correcting codes to create a bytestream such that, when burned 
onto a CD, you can make out a picture in the diffraction pattern?
I suppose this is a modern equivalent to line-printer artwork; I was 
imagining using a CD-RW drive to use the outer track, say, to spell out 
the disc title, creation time, etc. It would sure beat feeding CDs 
through a laser printer :-)

Yes, confirmed, but for my part, I'm using mostly non-antialiased fonts
and 
they are true ugly without the bytecode interpreter enabled.
Remember my stupid request about your RPM ;-)

I had to laugh at Rumsfield yesterday - when he was heckled by 
protestors, he said something like ""They couldn't do that in Iraq."" 
Meanwhile, from what I could tell, the protestors were being arrested.

ONE of Yorkshire's most famous sights yesterday became one of the first
targets in bizarre attacks on White Horse landmarks linked to the hunting
debate.
Villagers near Thirsk could not believe their eyes when they woke yesterday
to find the famous White Horse of Kilburn had acquired a rider during the
night.
In another incident, the Uffington white horse in Oxfordshire had a huntsman
and three hounds added to the ancient figure, which is thought to represent
a Celtic god or tribal symbol.
Pro-hunt activists in the Real Countryside Alliance (RCA)  a radical
alternative to the better-known Countryside Alliance  admitted
responsibility last night for targeting the two images.
The 314ft by 228ft landmark at Kilburn has been lovingly preserved since it
was carved in the limestone by schoolmaster John Hodgson and his pupils in
1857.
But during Monday night someone nailed on a massive figure of a huntsman
with a horn  which had been cut to scale out of a single piece of white
carpet. It was removed yesterday by members of Kilburn White Horse
Association, who found a Countryside Alliance badge attached to the carpet.
John Roberts of the association said: ""It has obviously been very well
organised. It was a well crafted piece of kit: a figure of a huntsman with a
horn cut out of carpets.
""It was big and impressive and could be seen for miles about. They tied it
to bushes at the top and nailed it down. It caused all the stone chippings
to be pushed downwards, which will help turn the white horse grey. It will
not get another refit for another year.
""Whoever did it must have come with a vehicle  a tractor and trailer or a
lorry  because the carpet must have come in one piece. It was extremely
well planned and took several people an hour and a half to get it off.""
The sculpture needs constant work because, unlike chalk horses in the south
of England, it is cut into limestone which is the wrong colour and needs
whitening.
Mr Roberts added: ""The damage as such is not great but it adds to the
deterioration, which means it will need more work next time.
""We would have more sympathy if, having made the point, they would come to
take it away again because it was a major job.""
Andy Wilson, chief executive of the North York Moors National Park, said:
""It is a scheduled ancient monument and the local residents are very proud
of it and go to enormous trouble to keep it white. There is also careful
consideration of what shape it should be kept with the constant growth of
vegetation so you can understand the alarm and regret at any changes. There
has not been a cut in the turf  which would be much more of a problem. It
would seem it was carefully plotted beforehand.""
An RCA spokesman said: ""Some people in the country are getting very
frustrated at the inaction. All we want is Ministers to take notice. Marches
don't seem to be doing anything good.""
The Countryside Alliance said it did not have any part in the action.
Spokesman Adrian Yelland said: ""The Countryside Alliance only ever advocates
campaigning that is lawful and dissociates itself from acts of vandalism and
regrets any damage that may have been caused by this incident.""
The incident follows graffiti on road signs and motorway bridges in
Yorkshire thought to be RCA work.

Opening arguments are set to begin early next month in Eldred vs. Ashcroft,
a landmark U.S. Supreme Court case that will decide the future of copyright
law, including how and when artists and writers can build upon the work of
others.
....
To heighten public awareness of the importance of the case an Internet
bookmobile is set to depart San Francisco next Monday on a trip that will
bring it to the steps of the Supreme Court building in Washington, D.C.,
before arguments wrap up. The van, which will be stopping at schools,
libraries and senior centers along the way, is equipped to provide free
high-speed access to thousands of literary and artistic works that are
already in the public domain.
--------
I had the opportunity to visit the Internet Archive about a month ago, and
saw the bookmobile under construction. It's a neat idea. Take an SUV, put a
small satellite dish on the top, and put a computer, printer, and binding
machine in the back. Voila -- people can search for a book, then print out a
copy right there on the spot. Quite literally on-demand printing. Total
fixed cost of the computer/printer/binding machine, if bought new (the IA
had the equipment donated) is under $10k.
One of the goals is to show libraries across the country that they could, if
they wished, add these ""virtual holdings"" (public domain materials) to their
existing library, at a fixed cost most libraries can afford. This should be
compelling to small libraries in remote areas.

					<P>US Airways scored a $500 million bankruptcy court bailout. American Airlines announced a re-org. United Airlines' parent company's stock sank on speculation that UAL is next in line for Chapter 11. It's a wonder none of this happened last September, but it's not much consolation to airline employees, shareholders, and customers that it's happening now.</P><P>
The Wall Street Journal had the most extensive coverage of American's plan as of Unspun's deadline. The airline will lay off 7,000 workers, ground some jets, cut back on flight amenities such as food, and retool its hub operations to make for longer layovers. ""In the past, airlines were loath to have longer connection times because flights were listed in travel agents' computers by elapsed time,"" said the Journal. ""Now, online booking tools and search engines most often list flights by price,
not time."" In this age of penny-pinching, American's worried about low-cost carriers, not the big guys like, um, US Air and United. </P><P>
Speaking of United, it's hard to come up with a verb for its parent company's stock that doesn't invoke an air disaster. Let's just say it didn't go up yesterday. The $3.80 share price may be the least of UAL's worries while it waits for an increasingly unlikely $1.8 billion loan from the Air Transportation Stabilization Board. ""The ATSB expects an applicant's workers, suppliers and creditors to make concessions to help the airline repay the loans and thus protect U.S. taxpayers' interests,""
said the L.A. Times. Sounds nice for uninvolved taxpayers but not so good to some of United's unions, which are balking at a wage cut. Workers did enough by deferring $498 million in retroactive pay this year, said the 36,000-member machinists' union. Analysts moaned in anti-labor frustration. </P><P>
The basic problem here is too many empty airplane seats, and non-U.S. outlets didn't have a lot of sympathy. ""The U.S. government has bailed out carriers with insurance subsidies and federal loan guarantees"" while ""European authorities have acted more wisely,"" letting Swissair and Sabena ""go to the wall,"" said the Financial Times. Canadian pundits agreed that America should let a couple of airlines wilt, since the Canadian airline industry benefited from the demise of Canadian Airlines and
Canada 3000. Paging Charles Darwin to the white courtesy phone... - Jen Muehlbauer</P>

					<P>The LinuxWorld Conference and Expo, which opened yesterday in San Francisco, will host two of the strangest bedfellows ever to lie down with a stuffed penguin: Microsoft and Sun. These are companies that once referred to Linux as a ""bathtub of code"" (Sun) and ""a cancer"" (Microsoft), according to Sun's hometown paper the San Jose Mercury News.</P><P>
Both companies are taking Linux seriously despite the absolute numbers. By January 2, 2001, Microsoft had made as much on server software as all Linux vendors put together would reap in the entire year.</P><P>
Honors for the best attention-grabber on Microsoft's presence at the show go to Brier Dudley, who opened his piece for the Seattle Times this way: ""Microsoft executive Peter Houston wasn't too worried about the reception he'd get at LinuxWorld ... until he heard about the pie cannon.""</P><P>
Wired informed us that the section of LinuxWorld where Microsoft will be holding the fort is dubbed the Rookery -- ""a place where you can watch companies hatch and grow right before your eyes,"" deadpanned reporter Michelle Delio, quoting Microsoft's Houston: ""Hatching isn't exactly on the agenda, but I certainly hope to grow.""</P><P>
Turning to Sun, Unspun notes that five years ago a joke press release circulated on the Net claiming that Linux creator Linus Torvalds, then still living in Finland, was moving to Silicon Valley to work for Sun. The joke was that Sun had decided to scrap its Solaris operating system and instead concentrate on a version of Linux, to be called ""Solinux."" How time does make April fools of us all: Linus Torvalds is now thriving in Silicon Valley (at Transmeta), and yesterday Sun Microsystems
demonstrated Sun Linux 5.0. and introduced its first general-purpose servers running Linux.</P><P>
The Merc ran a comprehensive wrap of Sun's evolving attitude toward the upstart operating system. Sun has little choice but to embrace Linux, wrote reporter Therese Poletti, because some of its traditional Wall Street customers were deserting it. ""Several investment banks have tossed out whole sections of Sun servers and replaced them with Intel-based servers running Linux,"" Poletti reported. And you thought Microsoft hated Linux? - Keith Dawson</P><P>

http://www.timesonline.co.uk/printFriendly/0,,1-43-351083,00.html
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
TONY BLAIR's special relationship with George W. Bush is under
considerable strain. Not only do the two disagree on Yassir Arafat's
tenure as leader of the Palestinian Authority, but Blair has started
telling disparaging anecdotes about the President.
Baroness Williams of Crosby recalled a story told to her by 'my good
friend Tony Blair' recently in Brighton. Blair, Bush and Jacques
Chirac were discussing economics and, in particular, the decline of
the French economy. 'The problem with the French,' Bush confided in
Blair, 'is that they don't have a word for entrepreneur.'

I don't care if the mail is foldered on python.org, but personal
messages regardless of who they're for, shouldn't be part of the
public spambayes repository unless specifically approved by both the
recipient and sender.
Note also that we are much more liberal about python.org/zope.org
mailing list traffic than most folks.  Read list-managers for any
length of time and you'll find that there are a lot of people who
assert strict copyright over their collections, are very protective of
their traffic, and got really pissed when gmane just started
gatewaying their messages without asking.
Which might be an appropriate for their lists, but not for ours (don't
think I'm suggesting we do the same -- I /like/ our laissez-faire
approach).
But for personal email, we should be more careful.

Parted is your friend! You can't do _everything_, the most limiting being
that you can't move the start of a partition, but it's quite powerful
nevertheless, and I've been very happy with it the few times I've had to
use it.

You're really better off backuping all placed where you know you've hand
edited or installed some files. For me that's only /etc/, /root/ and
/home/. Then you reinstall cleanly, formating ""/"", put your /home/ files
back into place and you're ready to go.
That's the moment I usually realize I had a nifty tweak to a file in
/etc/sysconfig/network-scripts/ or some special parameters added to an
/etc/modules.conf entry... so I look at my backup and make the same change
again. The only thing where you can get stuck is the grub.conf files,
because although there's a /etc/grub.conf link, it's actually in
/boot/grub/ so you may want to copy it too if you have special kernel
parameters to save (I have to pass ""pci=bios,biosirq"" for one of my
computers to work for example).
HTH,
Matthias

Haha!!!
Just a few notes:
 - It will be difficult to find, prosecute, and win money from someone
   in various non-friendly countries where spam originates (China is a
   good example) even if they do officially ""respect"" copyright law.
 - Law suits take time. Between now and conclusion of the first court
   case, we could have years of spam in our mail boxes!
 - Contact information can change: phone numbers, PO boxes, stolen
   cell phones, temporary email addresses, etc.
 - Spammers do not always remember to include contact information!  I
   don't understand it either, but nobody said they were bright.  Also,
   some spam is non-commercial or sent by a third-party (for example,
   ""pump and dump"" stock scams), so contact information is not strictly
   required for the spammer to get their way.

Once you have the serial changed on the master DNS server, remove
the appropiate zone(s) on your slaves, and refresh your DNS servers.
Bind has a special case, if you set the serial to '0' I think. DNS &
Bind should have something on that.

Horrors. Applets are kinda sucky. The cool kids are using Java to write
server applications, not browser craplets.
The giggle-inducing irony of the whole Java thing is how Sun's strategy
backfired. They produced a platform that was supposed to dwell on the
client side, where it would commoditize those clients. Instead, it turns
out to be the perfect language to write server applications in, and it has
successfully commoditized servers. Ooops!

There is a bit of circumstantial evidence - apparently some MT 
listers were approached by him (via email) - a little research in 
dejanews/google groups showed a number of messages from him, clearly 
hoping to contact girls, appearing in ""alt.teens"" and similar groups -
 I just tried a Google Groups search on ""Robert Moaby"" and some of 
them came top of the list.
Note for Marie - ""MT"" stands for Mark Thomas, a slightly slimmer, UK 
version of your Michael Moore - the mailing list is named after him.

Actually, it was worse - a bodycheck showed up a ""remove"" URL. I
need a new spam filter (but I want to be able to process false
positives, rather than dump them).

I have a prob when trying to install Linux (tried RedHat, Suse) on my
laptop. I can start the install but after about 2min, the whole pc just
dies.
I know it's not a Linux prob and here is what I have encountered:
I had the same problem when installing Win on it and eventually sorted it
out by disabling the infrared port. I'm guessing this might be same prob
although I'm not sure. I am very new to Linux so it's not that easy for me
to work it out. I did manage to follow the setup procedure at one stage
(using images on disks) and it cuts out either as it's trying to verify what
CD-Rom I have or just after (hence my suspicion of the infrared port again).
can anyone help ?
thanks
Gianni

I.

 From fairest creatures we desire increase,
That thereby beauty's rose might never die,
But as the riper should by time decease,
His tender heir might bear his memory:
But thou, contracted to thine own bright eyes,
Feed'st thy light'st flame with self-substantial fuel,
Making a famine where abundance lies,
Thyself thy foe, to thy sweet self too cruel.
Thou that art now the world's fresh ornament
And only herald to the gaudy spring,
Within thine own bud buriest thy content
And, tender churl, makest waste in niggarding.
      Pity the world, or else this glutton be,
      To eat the world's due, by the grave and thee.
--------------------------------------------------------------------
Shakespeare, William.  Sonnets.
William Shakespeare (1564-1616) was a famous English poet,
dramatist, and actor, often regarded as the greatest English
writer of all time. Shakespeare's early life was spent in
Stratford-upon-Avon, where little else is known about him
until he married at age 18 to Anne Hathaway.  He enjoyed
quick recognition as a skilled playwright in London as a
member of the Lord Chamberlain's Company (also known as the
King's Men).  He retired in 1610, having spent a successful
career as a writer and heralded by royalty and peasants
alike.
Shakespeare's privacy resulted in a sketchy timeline of the
writer's life, leading many over the years to attempt to
fill in the gaps, often with scraps of fact and fiction that
only result in nothing close to the truth (A truth we will
probably never know).  Among the rumors and hypotheses
offered over the years: that he was gay; a womanizer;
illiterate (reciting his works to a scribe), and a puppet
(in which he didn't write the works but was encouraged to
take credit to shield the real writer -- a person with
political ties).
Shakespeare's sonnets give readers a glimpse into the mind
and heart of the playwright.  Published in 1609, the 154
sonnets involve the author's relationship with various
characters, including a striking young man, a mysterious
woman, and a rival poet.  The identities of the characters
have also been the subject of much speculation over the
years, despite the fact that they may have been completely
created in the mind of the bard.

<p class=MsoBodyText style='text-align:justify'><b>CONSANTLY</b> being
bombarded by so-called FREE money-making systems that teases you with limited
information, and when its all said and done, blind-sides you by demanding your
money/credit card information upfront in some slick way,<b> after-the-fact</b>!
Yes, I too was as skeptical about such offers and the Internet in general with
all its hype, as you probably are. Fortunate for me, my main business
slowed-down (<i>I have been self-employed all my life</i>), so I looked for
something to fit my lifestyle and some other way to assist me in paying my
bills, without working myself to death or loosing more money; then, this
proposal to try something new without any upfront investment (<i>great! because
I had none</i>) interested me to click on the link provided. And I dont regret
at all that I did! I am very happy, and happy enough to recommend it to you as
a system that is true to its word. I mean absolutely no upfront money. You join
only if (<i>when</i>) you make money. You also get to track the results of your
time and efforts instantly and updated daily! I especially liked this idea of
personal control with real-time, staying informed statistics.</p>
<p class=MsoBodyText style='text-align:justify'><b>This system is quite simply
the most logical, opened, and fair of any others that Ive seen before. Why?
Because from the start, you get all the specific facts you need to seriously
consider if this is right for you. No teasing. No grand testimonies! No
kidding! Just the facts! Unlike in other programs that give you no idea of
their overall plan before first forking over your money/credit card; or worst
yet, joining and finding-out too late, after wasting valuable time trying to
figure them out, this system is straightforward and informative, providing you
with the two things you really must know: <u>Whats it all about</u>? and <u>How
does it work</u>?. These are the ultimate deal makers or deal breakers that
need to be immediately disclosed, well before discovering that maybe you dont
want to do that; by then you are hooked and now locked into a frustrating
battle to try to get your money back! </b></p>

I don't know whether it suggests that, but they would be tagged differently
in to/cc if I were tagging them at all right now.  If I were tagging To:
addresses, for example, the tokens would look like
    'to:email addr:mit'
instead of
    'email addr:mit'
as they appear when an email-like thingie is found in the body.  Whether
email addresses should be stuck in as one blob or split up as they are now
is something I haven't tested.",ham

my first time posting - have a bit of Unix experience, but am new to Linux.
 
Just got a new PC at home - Dell box with Windows XP. Added a second hard disk
for Linux. Partitioned the disk and have installed Suse 7.2 from CD, which went
fine except it didn't pick up my monitor.
 
I have a Dell branded E151FPp 15"" LCD flat panel monitor and a nVidia GeForce4
Ti4200 video card, both of which are probably too new to feature in Suse's default
set. I downloaded a driver from the nVidia website and installed it using RPM.
Then I ran Sax2 (as was recommended in some postings I found on the net), but
it still doesn't feature my video card in the available list. What next?
 
Another problem. I have a Dell branded keyboard and if I hit Caps-Lock twice,
the whole machine crashes (in Linux, not Windows) - even the on/off switch is
inactive, leaving me to reach for the power cable instead.
 
If anyone can help me in any way with these probs., I'd be really grateful -
I've searched the 'net but have run out of ideas.
 
Or should I be going for a different version of Linux such as RedHat? Opinions
welcome.
 
Thanks a lot,
Peter

The Freedom Rides
By Denis Mueller
At the end of World War II, the United States was a rigidly 
segregated country but there were cracks beginning to show. 
In 1946, the Supreme Court ruled that ruled that segregated 
seating on interstate transportation was illegal. In 1947, 
the Congress of Racial Equality (CORE) decided to challenge 
the racist system. The opposition was fierce and the riders 
were jailed often ending up on chain gangs.
By 1961, the time was right to challenge America's Jim Crow 
laws and CORE proposed the ""Freedom Rides."" CORE felt that 
they could count on the racists to oppose the rides thereby 
creating a crisis that would force the Federal Government to 
intervene to enforce the law. It would be dangerous and CORE 
members knew that they were risking their lives, but as CORE 
director James Farmer maintained they were ready.  ""When we 
began the ride I think all of us were prepared for as much 
violence as could be thrown at us. We were prepared for the 
possibility of death.""

On May 4th, 1961 they set out to New Orleans. In the upper 
south they met no resistance but by the time they got to 
Alabama they were met by an angry band of terrorists who 
slashed the tires and burned the bus. In Birmingham it was 
worse. The FBI, through its informant James Rowe, were well 
aware that the Ku Klux Klan was waiting for them. So were 
the Birmingham police, led by Chief of police Bull Conner, 
and when they arrived they were severely beaten. 
Despite the warnings there were no police to protect them. 
Governor Patterson showed no mercy and blamed the riders. 
So the terrorist attacks went on. The ""Freedom Riders"" were 
determined to continue and were joined by a group of Nash-
ville students. They were met by hostility and were arrested 
and sent back to Tennessee. But the riders were fearless and 
immediately returned to Birmingham ready to continue the 
journey.

Meanwhile, their plight became international news and 
""Freedom Riders"" left Birmingham on May 20th determined to 
continue. State officials had promised Attorney General Robert 
Kennedy they would be protected, but by the time they reached 
Montgomery there were no state police in sight. Seeing a mob, 
the riders feared for their lives, but Jim Zwerg, a white man, 
bravely walked out of the bus and was nearly beaten to death. 
He still suffers from the effects but his courage was un-
deniable. Others including Justice Department official John 
Seigenthaler were also beaten.
The situation seemed to be out of control and federal inter-
vention finally saved the day with Governor Patterson declar-
ing martial law. Robert Kennedy called for a cooling off 
period but the riders refused. They would continue on. So 
they set off to Jackson, Mississippi but  Kennedy had made a 
deal with Mississippi officials. They were supposed to be 
protected, but upon arriving they were arrested. Kennedy had 
caved in. It was a cowardly decision by the Attorney General 
and the riders were sentenced for 60 days for exercising 
their constitutional rights. They never finished their trip 
but their courage showed the power of civil disobedience and 
in the end justice would prevail and terrorism would be 
defeated. It is another example of how people change things, 
not government officials.

<div class=Section1>

<p class=MsoBodyText style='text-align:justify'><b>CONSANTLY</b> being
bombarded by so-called FREE money-making systems that teases you with limited
information, and when its all said and done, blind-sides you by demanding your
money/credit card information upfront in some slick way,<b> after-the-fact</b>!
Yes, I too was as skeptical about such offers and the Internet in general with
all its hype, as you probably are. Fortunate for me, my main business
slowed-down (<i>I have been self-employed all my life</i>), so I looked for
something to fit my lifestyle and some other way to assist me in paying my
bills, without working myself to death or loosing more money; then, this
proposal to try something new without any upfront investment (<i>great! because
I had none</i>) interested me to click on the link provided. And I dont regret
at all that I did! I am very happy, and happy enough to recommend it to you as
a system that is true to its word. I mean absolutely no upfront money. You join
only if (<i>when</i>) you make money. You also get to track the results of your
time and efforts instantly and updated daily! I especially liked this idea of
personal control with real-time, staying informed statistics.</p>
<p class=MsoBodyText style='text-align:justify'><b>This system is quite simply
the most logical, opened, and fair of any others that Ive seen before. Why?
Because from the start, you get all the specific facts you need to seriously
consider if this is right for you. No teasing. No grand testimonies! No
kidding! Just the facts! Unlike in other programs that give you no idea of
their overall plan before first forking over your money/credit card; or worst
yet, joining and finding-out too late, after wasting valuable time trying to
figure them out, this system is straightforward and informative, providing you
with the two things you really must know: <u>Whats it all about</u>? and <u>How
does it work</u>?. These are the ultimate deal makers or deal breakers that
need to be immediately disclosed, well before discovering that maybe you dont
want to do that; by then you are hooked and now locked into a frustrating
battle to try to get your money back! </b></p>
<p class=MsoBodyText style='text-align:justify'>I call this my Platinum
Choice because it stands alone as a true, superior deal that is totally
different from previously misleading, hook-first programs that promise lofty
mega-money jackpots, but really just want your money upfront to line their own
pockets! Youve seen the headlines: <u>Join free and Make $10,000 every week
for life</u> yeah, right!</p>
<p class=MsoBodyText style='text-align:justify'>I did not make millions yet,
but the whole thing was launched just a few weeks ago and I am more than happy
with my earnings, so far. I must tell you, I wouldnt be able to do anything
without corporate help  which was unusually thorough, timely, and motivating. </p>
<p class=MsoBodyText style='text-align:justify'>You have to see this in action
for yourself and make up your own mind; just go to my site and fill out the
form as soon as you can. You will get your own site in a few minutes. Then you
are ready to try whether you can make some decent money with this system and
the Internets explosive potential - fully loaded with hi-tech software, free
corporate help, on-time members support and even protective safeguards! </p>
<p class=MsoBodyText style='text-align:justify'>Get it now, and you can call me
at any time with questions. It really could help you like it is helping me to
finally be able to pay my bills, and keep my free time free. Good luck!</p>

I reran the experiment (with the new SpamHam1.pik, but it doesn't seem
to make a difference).  Here are the clues for the two spams in my
inbox (in hammie.py's output format, which sorts the clues by
probability; the first two numbers are the message number and overall
probability; then line-folded):
    66 1.00 S 'facility': 0.01; 'speaker': 0.01; 'stretch': 0.01;
    'thursday': 0.01; 'young,': 0.01; 'mistakes': 0.12; 'growth':

    0.99; 'content-type:multipart/related': 0.99; 'economy': 0.99;
    'economy""': 0.99
This has 6 content-types as spam clues, only one of which is related
to HTML, despite there being an HTML alternative (and 12 other spam
clues, vs. only 6 ham clues).  This was an announcement of a public
event by our building owners, with a text part that was the same as
the HTML (AFAICT).  Its language may be spammish, but the content-type
clues didn't help.  (BTW, it makes me wonder about the wisdom of
keeping punctuation -- 'economy' and 'economy""' to me don't seem to
deserve two be counted as clues.)

I've been looking into hotels.  I poked around expedia for availability
from March 26 to 29 (4 nights, wednesday thorugh saturday).  
I've also started contacting hotels for group rates; some of the group
rates are no better than the regular rates, and they require signing a
contract with a minimum number of rooms sold (with someone financially
responsible for unbooked rooms).  Most hotels are less than responsive...
	Radission - Barcelo Hotel (DuPont Circle)
	$125/night, $99/weekend
	State Plaza hotel (Foggy Bottom; near GWU)
	$119/night, $99/weekend
	Hilton Silver Spring (Near Metro, in suburban MD)
	$99/hight, $74/weekend
	Windsor Park Hotel
	Conn Ave, between DuPont Circle/Woodley Park Metro stations
	$95/night; needs a car
	Econo Lodge Alexandria (Near Metro, in suburban VA)
	$95/night
This is a hand picked list; I ignored anything over $125/night, even
though there are some really well situated hotels nearby at higher rates.
Also, I'm not sure how much these prices reflect an expedia-only
discount.  I can't vouch for any of these hotels, either.
I also found out that the down season for DC Hotels are mid-june through
mid-september, and mid-november through mid-january.

""""""
This one has no MIME structure nor HTML!  It even has a
Content-disposition which is counted as a non-spam clue.  It got
f-p'ed because of the many hospitality-related and money-related
terms.  I'm surprised $125/night and similar aren't clues too.  (And
again, several spam clues are duplicated with different variations:
'hotel', 'hotels', 'hotels.', 'subject:Hotel', 'rates,', 'rates.'.

I also looked in more detail at some f-p's in my geeks traffic.  The
first one's a doozie (that's the term, right? :-).  It has lots of
HTML clues that are apparently ignored.  It was a multipart/mixed with
two parts: a brief text/plain part containing one or two sentences, a
mondo weird URL:
http://x60.deja.com/[ST_rn=ps]/getdoc.xp?AN=687715863&CONTEXT=973121507.1408827441&hitnum=23
and some employer-generated spammish boilerplate; the second part was
the HTML taken directly from the above URL.  Clues:

The second f-p had the same structure (and sender :-); the third f-p
had the same structure and a different sender.  Ditto the fifth, sixth.  (Not posting clues for
brevity.)
The fourth was different: plaintext with one very short sentence and a
URL.  Clues:
   300 1.00 S 'from:email addr:digicool': 0.01; 'http1:news': 0.24;

The seventh was similar.
I scanned a bunch more until I got bored, and most of them were either
of the first form (brief text with URL followed by quoted HTML from
website) or the second (brief text with one or more URLs).
It's up to you to decide what to call this, but I think these are none
of your #1, #2 or #3 (they're close to #3, but all are multipart/mixed
rather than multipart/alternative).

It's possible that the corpus you've trained on is more homogeneous
than you thought.

what's the deal with all this latency? it's not like that in other places 
where I've used dsl. i read some story about it being done that way to 
allow greater distances to be covered or something like that. however, my 
knowledge of physics is really only newtonian, and I don't understand how 
worsening latency could possibly improve the reliability of a 2000 foot 
long piece of copper. Perhaps it has something to do with stretching the 
time-space continuum? can someone explain this in words of five syllables 
or less?

The CDs will probably cost less than 7.5 million to produce and 
distribute... ""didn't admit any wrongdoing""?!? Give me a break.

With due respect and humility I write you this letter which I believe you
would
be of great assistance to my children and I.
I got your contact through my husband commercial address book and believed
that
you must be a trust worthy and reliable person that will not like to
intimidate me
or betray my trust after hearing this news. I am a native of KONOBO in the
KEREMA
local district of SIERRA LEONE in West Africa and the wife of Late DR.
MUNDI A.
KOJO who was assassinated by the rebel forced loyal to Major John Paul
Koromah
because he was the Director General National Gold and Diamond Mining
Corporation
of Sierra Leone. Few days before my husband was assassinated, he 
instructed me
and my children (Ibrahim and Amina) to move out of Sierra Leone immediately,
before the powerful Economic community of West African States (ECOMOG)
forces
intervened, which eventually resulted into a brutal civil war. My children
and I
managed to escape to Togo through the help of my husband's friend. We came
into
Togo with some valuables including a cash sum of $25MILLION(TWENTY FIVE
MILLION
UNITED STATES DOLLARS ONLY) in two trunks boxes which I have deposited
with a
Trust Company here in Togo and special arrangement has been made with the
currier
company who will freight the money to your country.
Meanwhile, I want to leave Togo entirely with this money for investment in
your
country because of a stable political situation there and mostly for the
future of
my children. I want you to please assist us to claim this fund from the
Trust
Company in any of their branches in Europe, after which the fund will be
deposited
into your account for investment in your country. You should also help us to
source for good investment opportunity so that we can invest wisely in your
country when the fund is finally confirmed in your account.

Let me get this straight; a registry key is loaded from the server onto 
the client workstations who can modify it, then write it back onto the 
server's own registry - which is not going to use it?

What is the reason to write a registry key to a server if the server 
itself is not using it?
I don't think you should worry too much about someone travelling out of 
the hive, but again, I'm curious as to how the driver actually modifies 
the keys on the server.

And if the client writes the key back onto the server, yes, there's wide 
open for something nasty here.
Two other things spring to mind; 
1) If anyone can modify the key, how do you make sure that two users are 
not overwriting the same key, thereby causing undesirable effects.
2) If anyone have permissions to write to the key (and below), anyone can 
create thousands of extra keys under this key, thereby filling up the 
registry. The result of such a thing is obvious.
If I got this all wrong, I'd be happy that you clarify a bit more and tell 
me where I might have misunderstood.

kelly, same thing as when you used to come to frogstone on Dalnet. 
#frogstone is still there, and also #forteana. If you want to go to 
quakenet, just change your server (in mIRC if that is what you use) 
to that.

Not to beat a dead horse, but that's exactly what my spamcan package
did.  For those just tuning in, spamcan is a thingy I wrote before I
knew about Tim & co's work on this crazy stuff; you can download it from
<http://woozle.org/~neale/src/spamcan/spamcan.html>, but I'm not going
to work on it anymore.
I'm currently writing a new one based on classifier (and timtest's
booty-kicking tokenizer).  I'll probably have something soon, like maybe
half an hour, and no, it's not too hard.  The hard part is storing the
data somewhere.  I don't want to use ZODB, as I'd like something a
person can just drop in with a default Python install.  So anydbm is
looking like my best option.
I already have a setup like this using Xavier Leroy's SpamOracle, which
does the same sort of thing.  You call it from procmail, it adds a new
header, and then you can filter on that header.  Really easy.
Here's how I envision this working.  Everybody gets four new mailboxes:
  train-eggs
  train-spam
  trained-eggs
  trained-spam
You copy all your spam and eggs* into the ""train-"" boxes as you get it.
How frequently you do this would be up to you, but you'd get better
results if you did it more often, and you'd be wise to always copy over
anything which was misclassified.  Then, every night, the spam fairy
swoops down and reads through your folders, learning about what sorts of
things you think are eggs and what sorts of things are spam.  After she's
done, she moves your mail into the ""trained-"" folders.
This would work for anybody using IMAP on a Unix box, or folks who read
their mail right off the server.  I've spoken with some fellows at work
about Exchange and they seem to beleive that Exchange exports
appropriate functionality to implement a spam fairy as well.
Advanced users could stay ahead of the game by reprogramming their mail
client to bind the key ""S"" to ""move to train-spam"" and ""H"" to ""move to
train-eggs"".  Eventually, if enough people used this sort of thing, it'd
start showing up in mail clients.  That's the ""delete as spam"" button
Paul Graham was talking about.
* The Hormel company might not think well of using the word ""ham"" as the
  opposite of ""spam"", and they've been amazingly cool about the use of
  their product name for things thus far.  So I propose we start calling
  non-spam something more innocuous (and more Monty Pythonic) such as
  ""eggs"".

Wanting to sort like that is not common; I'd be surprised if exmh has
a widget for it.  You can achieve what you want with the command-line
mh tools, though.
I suggest doing the following from a shell prompt:
 sh -c 'for f in ""`folders -recurse -fast`"" ; do sortm +""$f"" ; done'
(The command ""sortm"" will sort a particular folder, and
""folders -recurse -fast"" prints out a list of all of your folders.)

I hope this helps,

have almost no problems with the choice of what gets pasted, or
selected, that stuff (for me, if perhaps not users of some gnome variant,
which appraently has been fixed anyway) all seems to work just fine.
The problem is that a button 1 click clears the selection (PRIMARY)
where it shouldn't - the previous selection should only be cleared
when there's something else to replace it (even if the highlighting
of what is selected is removed).     Try this in any other ramdom
application (from xterm to netscape) and see how it works.  There
normally is *no* (mouse based) way to actually clear the primary
selection (that is, set it to be a null string).
Then, because of the ""if I get asked for the selection value, I will
find something"" behaviour, if you click (intending to set the insert
point, the way most other GUI's operate), and then paste, because the
PRIMARY is clear, but exmh still owns the selection, because nothing
else has taken it, it does and finds some other ramdom stuff, from
either the clipboard or cut buffer, which tends to be something that was
deleted back in the ancient past, and pastes that.
That behaviour, to me anyway, is the real issue.
Once that gets fixed, we can switch back to operating the normal
""select stuff, click at new insert point, paste"" mode of operation
that almost everyone expects to work (whether the ""select stuff""
is somewhere in one of the exmh windows, or elsewhere).
kre
ps: this message is from my experience as a exmh user only, I've never
really understood enough about X and selections to go gazing at that
part of the code and see how it all really operates.

OK, gotcha.
I don't think you can do that with exmh, but you can do it on the
command line, if you use sh or ksh:
	for f in `folders -fast -r`
	do
		echo sorting $f ...
		sortm +$f
	done
It could take a long time.
At work, I have to use Outlook.  Ick.  I hate it.  But it does a few
things right.  Like making indices for each folder, and not just by
date, but also by sender, message size, subject.  So I can sort by any
column instantly.
I believe this is possible, too, with an IMAP compliant reader,
provided the IMAP server makes such indices.
I am facing the fact that exmh has been left behind in some industry
standards.  I use it for my personal mail.  My mail server runs unix,
and I connect over ssh and tunnel my X traffic over ssh.  With a slow
link, this makes exmh very slow.  And mime handling is pretty bad
compared with modern mailers.  I am just scared to move.  I've been
using MH or nmh since 1985 and exmh since 1995.  17 years is a long
time!

I had been hand building those alsa packages for probably 6 months or more, so I
could use my laptop's ESS chip best (hard disk recording and such). Wow, maybe 8 to
10 months, time flys. I didn't look forward to doing that tedious build every time I
changed a kernel or something. Matthias has made this a thing of the past! Dude,
it's a no brainer, use apt-get or just download and install.
What's more, OSS is fully ""imitated"", older apps using OSS are as happy as a clam.
My personal taste tells me newer apps which use alsa sound better (alsaplayer, xmms
with alsa module) to my ear.
The 2 things that trick people are the modules.conf file, they didn't have that
automatic matrix page when I started with alsa, you don't know how good you have it.
And on my old installs (only the first time I installed it on a clean box), alsa
always was ""muted"" until you fire up a mixer and turn up the music. It's possible
Matthias even took care of that too. Anyway it is/was only a one time thing on 1st
install, that was a long time ago for me.
Those ALSA dudes had been trying to get it into the 2.4 kernel but missed it, but
it's been in 2.5 for a while now, so alsa is the future of sound in the linux kernel.

Sure it is - it tends to bring out the people who let ""hysterical
right wing propaganda"" spew forth, while reaching for their gun 
whenever a ""liberal"" enters the room.
my hysterical left wing ""propaganda"" is generally an emotional
reaction on a mailing list, not an organizaed attempt at converting
people's thinking through lies and distortion (as was the original
article). 
Whereas your constant and predictable brandings of my postings are, to
 my mind, a deliberate and reasoned  effort to reduce debate, and
 discourage left of center postngs.

Apparently the angle on this (i.e. selling without guarantee) is that
software is not a product which is sold but a service which is licensed - at
least that's what I remember reading about how M$ gets away with providing
no guarantee in the U.S. If you're feeling rather deep pocketed, you could
always try suing M$ to get a court's view on the matter.

Falling asleep at the wheel is no laughing matter. Still, it kinda
happened with <a href=""http://www.lockergnome.com/issues/daily/20020716.html"">yesterday's
tip</a>. I forgot to mention that the String value's label
is ""Logging"" (sans quotes). That was almost like a cliffhanger,
eh? The oversight was totally my fault. I've been thinking about
asking Gretchen and Brian to help with future reviews. Don't be
surprised if that happens soon. I'm sure you'd welcome a female
perspective on this stuff, right? She helped one of our landlords
pick a paint color for the ""office"" wall this evening. Does that
qualify her to talk about cool stuff that we find for you on the
Internet? You betcha. Let's see how she does with the drapes and
rugs. I have a feeling I'll be the one tweaking furniture layout.
Shouldn't be too much of an issue - yet. I wonder if Ikea has an
affiliate program?
<p>
I've mentioned how Yahoo Mail's beta is mangling our commas, but
did you know that it's also (possibly) rewriting your e-mail? If
you send an HTML message to someone who has a yahoo.com account,
something may get lost in the translation. Try sending this
sentence: ""My medieval mocha has an expression to evaluate.""
Again, be sure this note is sent in HTML format. The results will
surprise you. As far as I can tell, they're doing this to stop any
scripts from being distributed to their user base. I must credit
Marion Schroll for making me aware of the ""problem."" It's kinda
funny, in a weird sort of way. Not that I would want anything I
send changed in any way, shape, or form. It begs the question:
what next? I mean, where does it all stop? Give them a bit, and
they just might take a byte. Censorship is only a stone's throw
away.
<p>
I really feel for Lockergnomie Sharon Clark, who asks: ""What is
this crazy business with the broadband metering? What they
advertise doesn't seem to be what you get. Now that I'm forking
out $60 per month for a supposed metered rate of 640 down / 320
up, I'm feeling clueless and left out in the cold. Not sure what
I'm paying for, not sure what's going on at the office, not sure
if I'm capped, not sure if I'm getting ripped off! Can you help me
out here? I'm feeling lied to; why can't I download 'til my 40 gig
is full? That is what they promised me and that is what I THOUGHT
I was paying for. I want consistent speed - is this too much to
ask?"" It's not too much to ask the question, but it's probably too
much to get the answer. I'm facing the same dilemma right now,
even though cable-based connectivity isn't available in my area.
Expect more and more ""filters"" to be put in place as time marches
on. Watch those EULAs, folks.

{List directory contents} When I was younger, I'd get so frustrated at those games where you'd have to pick out all of the subtle differences between two pictures. I'd always end up with one or two that I just could never see. When I want to do the same type of comparison between two directories on my computer, I use Directory Lister and I never miss a thing. Not only does Directory Lister display the contents of your chosen directories, it will also let you save the output to an HTML file. This is great for web developers who want a quick way to list the contents of a ZIP file before archiving it and uploading it to their website. As an added bonus, Directory Lister also shows the date, time, and attributes of the files in your directory, making it easier than ever to compare the differences in files between two directories.

{Web page reminder} Surfing the web as much as I do, I'll occasionally run into a site or page that commits the horrendous faux pas of displaying an ""Under Construction"" banner. I COULD forget about the site and maybe somehow encounter it later, or I COULD drop the site into Web Calendar and have this handy-dandy app remind me to check the page again in a week. The same technique holds true for my normal browsing... for example, I can use Web Calendar to remind me to check out the Digital Media newsletter every morning, or to check Amazon for a CD that I know will be released in a week. Now, I will have no excuse for missing the DVD release of ""Lord of the Rings""...

{Mix your own drinks} When I was in college, my room used to be known as ""The Bar."" It may have had something do with my L-shaped desk that resembled a bar, and the fact that I had seen the movie Cocktail too many times and wanted to be a bottle-flipping bartender. I never achieved my goal of being the world's best geek bartender, but maybe with College Bar I could have. College Bar contains recipes for over 11,600 drinks. With an online update feature, you can download new drinks as they become available... or you can add your own creative concoctions to the database! College Bar also has a calculator to determine someone's blood alcohol level... drink responsibly, folks. As an added bonus, you can load some of your favorite party pictures into the program and you'll see a slide show of those pictures - a great way to remember the good times... unless you don't remember experiencing them in the first place, that is. Dude, where's my car?

I am a sucker for keyboard shortcuts. Anything that can save me from using the mouse is good in my book. Occasionally I like to view the web or Windows Explorer in Full Screen mode... to do this I just hit F11 on the keyboard and there I am in Full Screen mode. Hit it again and I am back to regular mode. If you aren't as much of a fan of keyboard shortcuts as me, then all you have to do is press and hold the Ctrl key while clicking on the Maximize button and you will have the same effect. You will notice, however, that your Start Menu isn't anywhere to be seen. Never fear, another keyboard shortcut is here... just press Ctrl key plus the Esc key and your Start Menu will be back where it belongs. Alternatively, if you have a Windows key on your keyboard you can use that key to bring up your Start Menu as well.

They are legally required to do that.  I got a similar check because an
insurance company didn't pay a claim quickly enough.  It might have been
$.02.
Although they spent lots more than $.33 to mail you the check, the
alternative seems to be to keep the money.  Do you really want companies
to have a financial incentive to over-bill you 'just a bit' so they
could keep it?  For a company with millions of customers, $.33/customer
starts adding up.

worms. If you update your antivirus software on a regular basis,
these new versions of Frethem and Yaha shouldn't be a nuisance.
But if you haven't updated in a while, these variants--plus the
continuing threat of Klez.h--should motivate you. In security
news, a flaw in certain versions of PGP encryption could affect
Outlook users. Read on to learn whether you're vulnerable.

<P>
No. Many new viruses do not require a PC-based e-mail client such
as Outlook in order to spread. These new viruses, including 
Klez, have their own e-mail client (SMTP) and can find e-mail
addresses within cached Web pages on an infected machine,
bypassing the need to use Outlook's Address Book. Larger
Web-based e-mail services, such as Hotmail and Yahoo Mail, screen
mail hosted on their sites for viruses, but there's no beating
having a good antivirus product on your desktop just in case.

Nah, didn't say art's our priority.  Said our ideas about relationships

One thing that's wrong is who some of us choose as babysitters.  Too many 
kids are put in front of the television for hours each day, to be 
influenced by what the media and government thinks is important.  I 
learned a long time ago that what they think is important and what is are 
two different things.  I threw the TV out when Xi was 9.  She's got her 
own place now, and still doesn't have one.  YaY!  Another thing that's 
wrong is what goes on in public schools.  Some allow a bit of 
individuality, but only for a class or a short period of time, depending 
on the teachers, most of the time.  I dunno how many times I've seen Xi 
come home from school absolutely miserable or outraged about something 
that happened at school.  She made it to college, though, whew.  It's a 
big problem to tackle, and I don't know the answer.  I like the idea of 
the voucher system, because in a way it is a way parents can vote more 
efficiently for how their kids are taught.

You can't, because there isn't one, yet.  Habeas is using a 
combination of copyright and trademark law to protect their 
sender warranties.  They hope to patent the system, but they 
have not been ISSUED a patent.

I've never installed source rpms with apt, but I suppose that if you get
file not found, it's because the source rpm was installed. To see if this
is the case, go to /usr/src/redhat/SPECS/ and if you see mplayer.spec,
you'll just need to do ""rpm -bb mplayer.spec"" to get a binary build in
/usr/src/redhat/RPMS/i386/

computer-time to attack giant, sophisticated ciphers -- has cracked RC564. I 
used to have half a dozen computers working on this. 
    On 14-Jul-2002, a relatively characterless PIII-450 in Tokyo returned the 
    winning key to the distributed.net keyservers. The key 0x63DE7DC154F4D039 
    produces the plaintext output: 
    The unknown message is: some things are better left unread 
    Unfortunately, due to breakage in scripts (dbaker's fault, naturally) on 
    the keymaster, this successful submission was not automatically detected. 
    It sat undiscovered until 12-Aug-2002. The key was immediately submitted to 
    RSA Labs and was verified as the winning key.

I know it is possible to do per-folder customisation with components

Header forgeries are trivially easy to detect. The main way that 
spammers hide their originating IPs is not by forging headers, 
but by sending through open proxy servers.  It used to be that 
spammers used open relay mailserver, but these often betray the 
originating IP, and the proliferation of open relay blocklists, 
and the introduction of port 25 blocking on the part of many 
ISPs make open relays unattractive to spammers.
One would think, that the combination of a forged Habeas-SWE, 
and mail sent through an anonymizing open proxy would be a 
fairly good indication of spam.  Tracking a spammer to his 
meatspace location is not as difficult as you might think, once 
you have legal recourse to subpoena records.

Both can be found here :
http://ftp.freshrpms.net/pub/freshrpms/testing/alsa/
I've also repackaged gkrellm 2.0.2 with at last a separate package for the
server that can be installed standalone and doesn't even require glib2.
http://ftp.freshrpms.net/pub/freshrpms/testing/gkrellm/
Last but not least, my latest proftpd 1.2.6 package incorporates some nifty
new features : You can use any of ""--with ldap"", ""--with mysql"" and ""--with
postgres"" when rebuilding the source rpm with rpmbuild to enable desired
extra authentication methods and all package requirements are set
accordingly, and the release tag is changed too.
http://valhalla.freshrpms.net/ (the usual place ;-))
I think I'll use this ""--with <whatever>"" switch more and more where
possible. Some other of my package already use it like the xmame for its
output targets, sqlrelay for its modules and my latest sylpheed claws spec
to enable Pilot support.
As usual, feedback and comments are welcome! :-)

PS: Yup, I'm back from my holidays ;-)

 If you think you can survive it, please fight... When I found that patent I
found others that were just common sense, things that any geek could implement
with his script/shell-language of choice; and it's time for someone to get the
medias attention on what's going on.
 Basically this is the new wave of ""namenappers""; it used to be domainnames,
not it's all the basic general ideas they can think off/find on the web that
they're patenting.

And it is pretty common practice in some environments with public 
workstations to just wipe and re-install Windows machines on a weekly 
(or even daily) basis. It's easier than trying to maintain Windows.

article I was commenting on... Rohit]
In your article about Chinese attempts to censor Google last week (""The 
Search Goes On"", Sept. 19th), the followup correctly noted that the most 
subversive aspect of Google's service is not its card catalog, which 
merely points surfers in the right direction, but the entire library. By 
maintaining what amounts to a live backup of the entire World Wide Web, 
if you can get to Google's cache, you can read anything you'd like.
The techniques Chinese Internet Service Providers are using to enforce 
these rules, however, all depend on the fact that traffic to and from 
Google, or indeed almost all public websites, is unencrypted. Almost all 
Web browsers, however, include support for Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) 
encryption for securing credit card numbers and the like. Upgrading to 
SSL makes it effectively impossible for a 'man-in-the-middle' to meddle; 
censorship would have to be imposed on each individual computer in 
China. The only choice left is to either ban the entire site (range of 
IP addresses), but not the kind of selective filtering reported on in 
the article.
Of course, the additional computing power to encrypt all this traffic 
costs real money. If the United States is so concerned about the free 
flow of information, why shouldn't the Broadcasting Board of Governors 
sponsor an encrypted interface to Google, or for that matter, the rest 
of the Web?
To date, public diplomacy efforts have focused on public-sector 
programming for the Voice of America, Radio Sawa, and the like. Just 
imagine if the US government got into the business of subsidizing secure 
access to private-sector media instead. Nothing illustrates the freedom 
of the press as much as the wacky excess of the press itself -- and most 
of it is already salted away at Google and the Internet Archive project.
On second thought, I can hardly imagine this Administration *promoting* 
the use of encryption to uphold privacy rights. Never mind...
Best,

The search goes on
China backtracks on banning Googleup to a point
Sep 19th 2002 | BEIJING
 From The Economist print edition
IN CHINESE, the nickname for Google, an American Internet search engine, 
is gougou, meaning doggy. For the country's fast-growing population of 
Internet users (46m, according to an official estimate), it is proving 
an elusive creature. Earlier this month, the Chinese authorities blocked 
access to Google from Internet service providers in Chinaapparently 
because the search engine helped Chinese users to get access to 
forbidden sites. Now, after an outcry from those users, access has been 
restored.
An unusual climbdown by China's zealous Internet censors? Hardly. More 
sophisticated controls have now been imposed that make it difficult to 
use Google to search for material deemed offensive to the government. 
Access is still blocked to the cached versions of web pages taken by 
Google as it trawls the Internet. These once provided a handy way for 
Chinese users to see material stored on blocked websites.
After the blocking of Google on August 31st, many Chinese Internet users 
posted messages on bulletin boards in China protesting against the move. 
Their anger was again aroused last week when some Chinese Internet 
providers began rerouting users trying to reach the blocked Google site 
to far less powerful search engines in China.
Duncan Clark, the head of a Beijing-based technology consultancy firm, 
BDA (China) Ltd, says China is trying a new tactic in its efforts to 
censor the Internet. Until recently, it had focused on blocking 
individual sites, including all pages stored on them. Now it seems to be 
filtering data transmitted to or from foreign websites to search for key 
words that might indicate undesirable content. For example earlier this 
week when using Eastnet, a Beijing-based Internet provider, a search on 
Google for Falun Gonga quasi-Buddhist exercise sect outlawed in China
usually aborted before all the results had time to appear. Such a search 
also rendered Google impossible to use for several minutes.",ham

The procmail bug happens when the filter program does something that 
procmail doesn't expect.  Exactly what that something is, hasn't been
confirmed by anyone on the procmail list.  It might be exiting with a
nonzero status, or it might be producing output on the standard error,
or it might be something else entirely.
So Simon is attempting to get SA to run flawlessly, because then it can't
tickle the procmail bug.  This isn't a fix, it's a band-aid, but because
he apparently doesn't have the option of installing a newer procmail ...",ham

    Javawalk is a two-hour walk in the city center. We start at Union Square 
    and wind through Chinatown, Jackson Square and North Beach, the city's 
    Italian district. While we cover the city's coffee roots (much more 
    significant than Seattle's!) and coffeehouse culture (think beatnik), we 
    also spend some time on San Francisco's history, interesting and arcane 
    trivia and stories the Javagirl has collected from many years of living in 
    the city. Truly, some things could only happen in SF! Javawalk also makes a 
    couple of stops at North Beach cafes for a quick java jolt. Since cool 
    weather prevails here, we need coffee year-round in the city by the Bay. 
    Lucky us!

Gregory Alan Bolcer <gbolcer@endeavors.com>,Rohit Khare <khare@alumni.caltech.edu>,Fork@xent.com,,,,,unsubscribe,Re: Lord of the Ringtones: Arbocks vs. Seelecks,<3DA4DCC7.6060601@endeavors.com>,"I got to see Powell talk in March 2001 at the beginning of his
reign at the FCC.  He said they were going to take a real
hands off approach, so it's funny that they would blame
the regulators for causing the collapse.  One thing he did
get right, is that he wasn't worried that the US was behind
Europe in the wireless licensing spectrum.  This is something
very prescient in that most of those licensors have had to
eat their lunch over the huge licensing costs they paid for
very little benefit.  His legacy was/is supposed to be
rethinking the FCC's role to stay out of the way in this
period of business innovation in the wireless space as he
didn't want the government forcing business models onto
the private sector.
His full transcript is here [1].  Interestingly enough I
got to see his speech in person as he was part of the whole
CTIA'2001 Las Vegas keynote series of speakers.  Clay and
I hoped a flight out of Ontario to Las Vegas to do demo support
for Craig Barrett [2].  His message was that there's no difference
between wired and wireless Internet--it's all the same thing.
Instead of scalable networks, we should be thinking about scalable
content (& using Magi he showed sending a blue man tv commercial
from a desktop to a laptop to an ipaq to a color smartphone with
the content scaling back for each target platform).
The best part of the whole trip wasn't hobnobbing at all,
but really the fact that the Venetian had ran out of rooms.
They decided to put us up in one of their $10,000/night high
roller rooms.  They put Clay in one and me in another.
The Venetian is known for having the largest hotel rooms
anywhere, but these ones were bigger than my whole house. 8-)

(Actually, it flares up continuously in various circles. In fact, I think it's 
about time for it to flare up again in weblogging circles. These things are 
inexorably cyclical. CSS-vs-tables is the hemorrhoid of the web design world. 
But I digress.) 
If you were around back then, you will no doubt recall that I was in the 
pro-CSS camp[1]. 
So anyway, d'ya remember that argument that went something like &#8220;you 
should design with web standards and CSS because it will future-proof your site 
for the pie-in-the-sky future when people surf the web on mobile 
devices&#8221;? Well, it's crap[2]. 
There are lots of good arguments for designing with web standards and CSS: 
automatically print-friendly pages[3], dynamic style switchers[4], reduced 
bandwidth[5], and aiding and abetting accessibility[6] (a topic which I claim 
to know a lot about[7]), among others. But &#8220;because it'll future-proof 
your site for the next generation of mobile devices&#8221; is not one of them. 
The theory is solid, but apparently nobody told the makers of the mobile 
devices (now that we have them) how it was all supposed to work in practice.

Possible - should be, it was possible to update to (null) from RH7.3 with 
apt. Did that on my laptop and well.. it was painfull to say the least 
(including a ecovery from totally corrupted rpmdb) Don't expect it to be 
an easy 'dist-upgrade' at any rate, so much stuff has changed and apt 
doesn't always handle all that well the way dependencies are set in 
RHL.

It's possible but not supported by RH. I've upgraded both my laptop and my 
home box from (null) to RH8.0 and didn't encounter any issues though.

class of person -- has an essay about a subject near and dear to my 
(non-car-owning) heart: Why is it so damned hard to get a cab in San Francisco? 

    In fact, no cab company ever tells a driver to pick up anyone. When you 
    phone a cab firm in San Francisco, your call is treated not as an order, 
    not as a binding oral contract, but simply as a request... 
    So, why don't cab companies ensure that we pick you up on time-or at all? 
    In a nutshell, labor law states that if a cab company actually commands a 
    driver to carry out a specific action, that constitutes an 
    employer-employee relationship. But if a company farms its work out to 
    independent contractors, it can rid itself of costly expenses such as 
    disability and social security taxes. It also means that the contractor 
    drivers can't unionize.

It could be an online system that work 95% offline but poll frequently an 
offsite server.  No mass production CDs, maybe mass personalised d/l like Sun 
JDK.
Nothing is fixed yet, we are looking at the way a software can be protected 
from unauthorized utilisation.  
Is the use of ""trusted hardware"" really worth it ?  Does it really make it 
more secure ?  Look at the DVDs.

I don't think there's much more room for lowering FPs left which the GA can 
achieve.  Remember, also, that the AWL will reduce FPs, but its effects aren't 
factored in to the GA scores.
The work currently being done on the GA, and comparing different methods of 
doing the score-setting, is very worthwhile, and extremely useful; however, we 
really ought to get a release out, since 2.31 is getting decreasingly useful as 
time goes on.
The FP/FN rate of 2.40 with pretty well *any* score-setting mechanism will be 
better than 2.31 -- we can continue with adjusting how the scores are set on the 
2.41 or 2.50 branches.

You could just allow low and high to be evolved by the GA (within ranges); I'd 
be enormously surprised if it didn't end up with low=-12 and high=+6, since 
that'd give the GA the broadest lattitude in setting individual scores.  The 
issue with fixing low and high is not one of optimization, but rather one of 
human-based concern that individual scores larger than about +4 are dangerous 
and liable to generate FPs, and individual scores less than -8 are dangerous and 
liable to be forged to generate FNs.
DQ> Maybe even add a nybias loop.
Adding an nybias loop is not worthwhile -- changing nybias scores will just 
alter the evaluation function's idea of what the FP:FN ratio should be.

wings, it can cause a hurricane a month later halfway around the world? As 
several people have already noted, Google has made some major changes in their 
most recent update. The weblogging community was hit hard (for instance, I used 
to be the #1 ""mark""[1]; I am now #6). The changes appear to be the result of an 
attempt to stop two phenomena: explicitly selling ads based on PageRank[2], and 
Google bombing[3]. 
Specifically, Google is now apparently cross-checking link text with the linked 
site, and discounting or ignoring links whose text does not appear in the 
linked site. This all but kills off Google bombing. Searching for ""go to hell""
[4] no longer takes you to microsoft.com[5]; searching for ""talentless hack""[6] 
no longer finds ohmessylife.com[7], although it finds a lot of people who were 
previously participating in the Google bombing. No definitive word yet on 
whether Google is actively penalizing such sites. 
Unfortunately, the algorithm tweaks necessary to stop these two techniques have 
caused a wide range of collateral damage, apparently coming down hardest on 
medium-to-large sites that had previously been doing everything right (as far 
as page structure, link structure, accessibility, and general honest hard work 
putting together a usable and useful site). The Webmasterworld forums are alive 
with complaints and speculation: 
- New update, pagerank death?[8] 
- September 2002 Google Update Discussion - part 1[9] 
- Let's find out what happened - Sept 2002 Update - pt. 2[10] 
(Side note: amongst the confusion, it has been suggested that Google is no 
longer indexing ALT text in images. I can confirm that this is absolutely 
false. Searching diveintomark.org for ""gimli""[11] finds my entry of July 29[12]
, where ""Gimli"" is mentioned only in the ALT text of an image.) 
Regardless, Google's search results in general appear to be significantly 
degraded in many key areas. The forums are full of people complaining that spam 
sites, doorway pages, and obvious cloaking attempts, which Google used to be so 
good at filtering out, are now popping up in top spots with disturbing 
frequency. Nobody in the forums wants to talk about which keywords they're 
tracking, so I tried to find my own concrete example of crap search results. It 
didn't take long. 
- Searching for reservation hotel[13] brings up an empty sub-page[14] of a 
hotel reservation company in Italy[15] as the first result. This seems 
unhelpful, and unlikely to be relevant to the average US-based consumer (and 
Google absolutely knows I'm in the US based on my IP address). 
- Searching for news observer nc[16] (the News & Observer is a Raleigh, NC 
newspaper) does find The News & Observer[17], but it also finds an Internet 
betting spam page[18] at #7 and a non-existent page[19] at #9. 
- Searching for eminem[20] gives us two generic portal pages, a non-existent 
site, and a site that redirects to a site that continuously redirects to itself 
(I am not making this up). And this is just on the first page. Good thing I 
didn't care that much about Eminem to begin with, because Google just isn't 
that helpful. 
Many people in the Webmasterworld forums are now suggesting that AllTheWeb.com
[21] has better search results overall. Just as a single comparison, their 
results for ""eminem""[22] do appear to be much more relevant. Is this the 
beginning of the end of Google's reign?

So Eugen, how many of your homo friends have -had- 3k lovers?
In fact, thats a general question for FoRK proper.

Just a quick assumption here.   I'm not a math geek or anything, but

very very few of us are -that- lucky (or even close to that lucky)

Mario Torre <neugens@libero.it>,secprog@securityfocus.com,,,,,,unsubscribe,Encryption approach to secure web applications,<200208222015.15926.neugens@libero.it>,"Hi everybody!
I'm writing a web application in java (tomcat + jsp/servlets + database 
access with postgreSQL).
This will be released under the GPL and will eventually be useful as a 
framework for other web applications.
The application main focus is e-commerce, but not limited to that.
I would like to use some form of cryptography to protect data on the 
database, but I have some problem figuring out the right approach.
Above all, how to store passwords and keys in a shared web server.
A problem that I was unable to solve is how to store keys for 
encryption/decryption. The api that I'm using is the jca (jdk1.4.x), 
and the methods of saving generated keys in keystores fails always. 
I can serialize the object, and store in the database, but this is not 
the most secure approach: this key is needed to decrypt data in the 
database, but the database is accessible from the web application. 
Assuming that I can find a good and secure place where to store the 
database password, I can use a different database with different 
user... Argh... to complex and doesn't really solve the problem.
Where I can found good documentation about this topic?
There is another approach that I would share with the list, something I 
thought that can be of bit interest, but probabily wrong and insecure. 
After all, I'm a real beginner in secure programming, and I'm here to 
learn methods and technics.
First of all, I need a secure way to keep database passwords secure, so 
I have to keep them separate from the main server. The right approach 
could be using a small java bean application that run as normal user 
(not tomcat, so it is not shared with other web services or, worst, the 
nobody user), that has no shell login, but has a default home directory 
or a place where it can hold passwords and keys.
The web application could then open an ssl connection (could be done in 
the init method at server startup) to get database passwords. The small 
bean could check via code signature/rmi/whatever else that the source 
is the right one, and handle all the database connections, or give the 
db connection/password to the main web application.
In this way, we solve the problem of keeping the keys and passwords in 
shared directories, and also, an attacker should get root/bean user 
account to read data. This is not perfect, and works only if your 
provider gives the opportunity to configure a separated java 
application (that means, really, another server running in the 
background).
Any suggestions?
Thank you,
Mario Torre

>OK, but only if you also meant religious and alcoholic extremes ;)
Since it was my quip, I'll point out that I used
the term ""alcoholism,"" implying addiction. I
drink. I'm not an alcoholic. Most people who drink
don't go to AA meetings. Most people who go to AA
meetings do (try very hard) not to drink.
As to religion, I think it is harmful and risky in
almost any degree. Were I single, I might consider
potential mates who partook of the less irrational
or more light-hearted religions. A Unitarian or
Buddhist might be an example of the first, a Wiccan
of the second. But someone who is both irrational
and serious about that irrationality strikes me as
a bad choice of partner, moreso than someone who
was addicted to some drug. Alcoholics and drug
addicts at least have the sense to battle their
problem, and to keep their children from suffering
it. The religious revel in their irrationality,
and want to raise their children in it. That's a
difficult difference for two parents to
reconcile.
Fortunately, I am long and happily enamored of
someone who has no religious tendencies.

Now my demands are growing ;-)
I use my laptop remotely very often and now I would
like the bell to sound on that when I am there.
I triedto use the KDE remote sound server and it works in
the tests, but when procmail runs it it doesn't, presumably
as it doesn't have the authorization to communicate with
the laptop, beeing another user?
Any hints.

So thought I, but apparently all it favours is a lot of whining about good
old times, the inability of youngn's to pay for your pension and the
health insurance, and the generic influx of uncouth furriners, which must 
be stopped, Somehow.

So outside of the occasional hit by a mafia-boy, where's the killing?
If you said mind-numbing, rights destroying, cynic-making force, I'd
agree.  But, does politics really kill?
I'm bitter atm.  Two reasons mostly:
1) I was listening to what I heard being the First Amendment
Foundation? on NPR releasing a poll noting that their
very-unscientific poll found that half the population thinks the first
amendment goes too far.   And (their quote was 1 in 5, but I'm finding
sources of 1 in 4) of the population don't even know what rights are
guaranteed in the first amendment.
2) I have a paper due that will make or break my law school career.  I
hate being a forced sheep.

Looks promising!  Getting 6 lines of output for each block would give a

gives you the same information as ""sendmail -d0.1 < /dev/null"", which
doesn't include milter information.  (actually the -d0 part gives you the
info, the $Z gives you sendmail version out of the test mode (-bt)... so
it's slightly different, but not really.)

Too early IMO (if you mean to leave the various other tools out of
it).  If and when we package this, perhaps we should use Barry's trick
from the email package for making the package itself the toplevel dir
of the distribution (rather than requiring an extra directory level
just so the package can be a subdir of the distro).

Has anyone made a working source RPM for dvd::rip for Red Hat 8.0?
Matthias has a spec file on the site for 0.46, and there are a couple of
spec files lying around on the dvd::rip website, including one I patched
a while ago, but it appears that the Makefile automatically generated is
trying to install the Perl libraries into the system's, and also at the
moment dvd::rip needs to be called with PERLIO=stdio as it seems to not
work with PerlIO on RH8's Perl.

Not too sure what the cleanest way to fix this is - anyone working on
this?

Thanks,

My problem is not the same as MS's one, I don't have to deal with millions of 
identical copy of the same CD with propably millions of working keys.  Each 
download can be unique with a small preparation delay.  The key generator is 
a problem only if multiple keys are usable.  If the end users are teenagers, 
you'll face a huge wall when asking to be 100% of the time online but if we 
think of something like a health care system that keep track of patients 
personnal information, the end user will be willing to take every possible 
steps to protect the system from his own employees to use illegaly.
I agree with all of you that mass production CDs will not be safe from piracy 
in a near futur.  That can be seen as a collateral of mass market 
penetration.
BTW thanks for all of you who provided interestiong insight.  I'm playing with 
gdb's dissassembler now but I don't think it's what a typical cracker would 
use.  Any hints on UNIX cracking tools ?
Thanks.

The ""--define"" is exactly what I was looking for! I was trying to
figure out a way to do it within the mechanism of rpm (like the
""--with"" switches), but for some reason didn't think of using
""--define"". My computer is currently gone for repairs, but once it's
back, I'll rewrite the specfile, add support for kernel-smp, and email
it to the list for further criticism :)
As far as requiring kernel-source, I don't feel it's a big problem. If
you're gonna go to the trouble of packaging custom kernels into rpms,
it's not a far stretch to package the source tree too (as I currently
do).
Also, I've found that the alsa-driver source needs a usb-related patch 
to compile under the latest test kernels (2.4.20-preX). Are other 
people seeing the same thing, or is this just a problem with my setup?
gary
P.S. If I didn't mention it before, thanks for the alsa packages! They 
greatly simplified what used to take way too long before.

The problem is that all the entries show ""is not known spam""  I can't believe 
I'm that lucky.  So, how do I test to see that my razor installation is 
working properly.  I've been up to my ears in documentation for the past few 
days, so, if the reference is easy, just point me to it.  Otherwise a brief 
hint on how to, would be appreciated.

Well I dont have to worry about microwavers in the house. Ours died a week
or so ago and due to doing some research we will nto be getting anysuch
device in the near or far future. I mean even if one half of the crap it
is reported to do is true it s just not worth it for a quick cup or warm
chai.
Which brings me to the fact that finding a good Convection only (not combo
with a microwaver) oven of any good size is dang near impossible unless
you go up to the bizness sizes. thankfully there is Dehlongi of which
costco has thru thier online store.
Now of course the question is do we get it delivered to the old house or
the new one (yep we got our offer approved and are in the short run down
to a long mortage:)  we close on oct 31. though the realestate agent says
t happens like that a lot, I still find it incrediably jolting to have
found a house inthe hood I want with the space dawn wants on sunday and we
are signing papers on tuesday night with a close at the end of the month.
Which of course means....wifi land for wsmf:)- )
So far I like the Linksys dsl/cable router all in one wifi ap. The Dlink
has the funky 22mb stuff IF you use all thier stuff across the net and the
way things go I cant say thats gonna happen for sure. Pluse the Linksys
stuff is all over the mass market sotres so I cna walk home with parts at
any time.
The fun now comes with a realization that with ATTbi cable as my main hose
tot he net offering up bwf might be a tad problematic....So i am thinking
of ways around/through/under that. the setup of the particualrs are far
form set in stone...any ideas would be welcome.
Also any portlanders.....party time.

It was a crushing blow to discover that <a 
href=""http://www.cnet.com/software/0-3227852-1204-9931175.html"">Vindigo</a>, my
all-time-favorite Palm app, was no longer free. Twenty-five bucks
wasn't steep, but the principle of paying for a former freebie
was hard to swallow. Not that hard, though; surprising
myself--and my fellow cheapskates--I've discovered that I'd
rather dish out the dough than go Vindigo-free myself.
<p>
That's what Web-based e-mail providers are banking on. Now that
most of us have gotten sucked in by those gratis Web e-mail
accounts, most ""free"" Web e-mailers have started charging for
premium services or imposing strict limitations on free accounts.
Read our <a 
href=""http://home.cnet.com/software/0-3227888-8-20089773-1.html"">reviews</a> 
of the four top services to see what you get if
you dish out the dough (or not)--and which to avoid if you want
to stay spam-free.
<p>
Surfacing on this week's Buzz Meter is another free-gone-fee app.
The latest version of the popular file-sharing software BearShare
now offers a paid version that lets you search and download
without those annoying ads. Maybe the best things in life are now
those with a fee.

I hate to put it first, but unfortunately, all other

This new version of the well-known peer-to-peer

Yeah, that's exactly what I was doing--I didn't realize I was incurring
administrative pickle bloat this way.  I'm specifically trying to make
things faster and smaller, so I'm storing individual WordInfo pickles
into an anydbm dict (keyed by token).  The result is that it's almost 50
times faster to score messages one per run our of procmail (.408s vs
18.851s).
However, it *does* say all over the place that the goal of this project
isn't to make the fastest or the smallest implementation, so I guess
I'll hold off doing any further performance tuning until the goal starts
to point more in that direction.  .4 seconds is probably fast enough for
people to use it in their procmailrc, which is what I was after.

Look for ""Zygalski sheets"".
By Koerner's* narrative, it wound up
being a hybrid affair: Bletchley had
mock Enigmas which cycled through the
Enigma's ~18k starting positions in a
quarter of an hour, but the Germans
started using a plugboard which then
had ~1.5x10^14 possibilities.  The
Poles noticed that there were some
patterns in the messages which were
only possible via certain plugboard
settings, and so:
> When we have collected several such cards corresponding to different
> initial signals ..., we place them in a pile so that the squares
> corresponding to the same daily settings are aligned and shine a
> light beneath the pile.  Only those squares which let the light
> through will correspond to possible daily settings.
So the brute force hardware allowed
precalculation of ""optical"" computing
devices which then narrowed down the
possibilities enough for brute force
to again be used for daily decodes,
until:

Subject: [SAtalk] 2.41/2.50 spamd/spamc problem

I noticed that after upgrading to 2.41 (or 2.50) from 2.31, the -F
option was removed from spamd. 
This is fine because all of the HTML format mail seems to arrive
properly. However, messages that get tagged as Spam arrive as just html
source.
Is there any way around this? I would like all HTML/RTF messages to
retain their formatting even if they are flagged as spam. I would
accomplish this on 2.31 by using the ""-F 0"" flag when starting spamd.
Thanks!

Paul Fries

I think people will be much more motivated to report spam than ham.  I
like the general approach that copies of random messages will be
sequestered for some period of time before they're assumed to be ham.
Matched with a simple spam reporting scheme, this could keep the
training up to date with little effort.  I've sketched out an approach
a listserver like Mailman could do along these lines and if I get some
free time I'll hack something together.
I like the idea of a POP proxy which is classifying messages as
they're pulled from the server.  The easiest way for such a beast to
be notified of spam might be to simply save the spam in a special
folder or file that the POP proxy would periodically consult.

I was eating in a restaurant in chinatown in Boston.  The place was empty.  
The only other customer was a white guy reading an asian-language 
newspaper.  The guy asked the waiter for help translating a word.  
Eventually his story came out.
He had married an asian woman through one of these introduction services.  
after about a year of marriage she had charged him with assault and left
him, leaving no contact information.  He was hanging around in Chinatown,
asking random asians for help finding her.
I obviously don't know if he did assault her, but what struck me was that
the possibility of mutual exploitation is high.
Anecdote number two:
In college I had a job as a street vendor.  There was a guy I worked with
who was a lifer in the job.  He was a noticably messed up guy.  Among
other odd characteristics he fawned on women customers, doing stuff like
offering them flowers.
I asked him about it.  He said that he'd never had sex with a woman who
wasn't a prostitute, and his dream was to save up enough money to get a
mail order bride.
I was really moved.  The guy was a loon, but he wanted a companion as much

I'm reading this now as that you trained on about 220 spam and about 220
ham.  That's less than 10% of the sizes of the training sets I've been
using.  Please try an experiment:  train on 550 of each, and test once
against the other 550 of each.  Do that a few times making a random split
each time (it won't be long until you discover why directories of individual
files are a lot easier to work -- e.g., random.shuffle() makes this kind of
thing trivial for me).",ham

Someone seems to have done a very complete QA test on it; yesterday I installed it for the first time on an old Celeron box.  Sure, parts of it were slow, but compared to my more modern machine, everything is.  It was good; a beautiful interface that legions of 'sheep' can look at and say ""Cool; I can understand this"" and leave their shackles behind.  :)
    I was struck by the massive amount of applications, both KDE and Gnome, intuitively seperated NOT by the Gnome/KDE names, but by their **meanings** instead.  It's obvious that someone spent a lot of time improving the usability and graphics to make it more 'international'; the web browser graphic, for example, has a 'world' icon with a mouse wrapped around it. Office-apps have familiar pens, paper, and/or calculators involved.
    This is a Linux that I can plop down in front of almost anyone, and they can figure it out.
    At some point I'd miss the character of KDE/Gnome, and I'll probably 'hotrod' the graphics setup with my own themes, etc.  But for the wide release, this one's IT.  If you get a chance, try this; I think you'll be surprisingly pleased.

No reboot is required, you just need to remount it:
	# mount -o remount,rw /usr
This requires root access, but presumably /usr is safe from non-root
users anyway.
Only way to disable this is to have the kernel compiled with something
that compartmentalizes capabilities (LIDS/etc on Linux for example) or to
remove CAP_SYS_ADMIN with lcap, which would definately require a reboot,
and possibly break some other functionatily to boot.  (Pun intended.  My
apologies.)

Agreed, especially since my packages are primarily meant for the original
Red Hat Linux kernels. And someone removing USB support from his kernel is
probably not going to recompile ALSA with *all* the drivers anyway ;-)

Dear sir/madam

With good recommendation,I  decided to contact you.
I am PRINCE DAVID  SAVIMBI, the son of JONAS SAVIMBI ,the leader of the
UNITA rebel in ANGOLA, who  was killed in february by the troop loyal to
the government .After his funeral  and burial,we had a family meeting and
resolved to invest the money he left  behind in your country, hence this
letter to you.He left the sum of $80 million  us dollars in cash, which was
a proceed from the sale of diamonds,which was  under his control.

However,the entire  development made us to flee ANGOLA to JOHANESBURG,SOUTH
AFRICA, for fear of  being killed.
The amount of $80 million  united states dollars in cash is presently in our
possession, and I would want it  to be invested in your country,due to the
stability of your economy.The money is  presently with an emergency
diplomatic security courier company,which my mother and I hurriedly used to move the
cargo out from our country to SOUTH AFRICA.We  registered it under a security
code with no name, and was registered as  containing photographic paper
material.

My mother and I have resolved to give you  15% of the total sum for your assistance in
getting this funds transferred to  your reliable company's account in your
country,for investment.We have equally  resolved to spend the rest of our
lives in your country.You have to  make traveling arrangement
of coming to JOHANESBURG,SOUTH AFRICA,immediately to  meet with me face to
face and see the funds physically,then have it transferred  to your
account.Afterwhich both of us would travel together to your country for
sharing and immediate investment,then my family will join me later.

As we await your urgent  reply, strictly through my e-mail davsav@maktoob.com or
 davidsavimbi@maktoob.com  or my private phone number +882 1 646685229.  your
absolute trust and confidentiality is highly solicited to serve us better.

Best regard
PRINCE DAVID SAVIMBI",spam

Why ""Eek""? :-)
If no /dev/dvd exists, it'll create it.
If /dev/dvd exists, it won't touch it.
If someone installs ogle (a DVD player), I'm assuming the hardware is
recent enough for software playback and that the drive is a DVD-ROM... all
of them support DMA! But since that change requires a reboot or a manual
change, I'm still hesitating to integrate it :-/
My goal is to allow users to install a DVD player through synaptic and play
DVDs in no time. Outputting a message in the %post section of a package is
always a bad idea, putting the tip in the %description sounds good though.

Sorry about that,
procmail is run by the qmail delivery agent to presort all mail
I get.
But anyway, I found an error message in procmail.log, which solved
the problem.
The following line in my delivery script seems to work fine now:
DISPLAY=<laptop>:0.0 artsplay <soundfile>
Thanks

Doesn't seem *likely*, as it appeared in about 900 of about 14,000 spams.
It could be specific to one of his bait addresses, though -- don't know.  A

Well you are right, sorry, I didn't have any better idea yesterday late in
the evening.
The fonts are ugly only inside of gnome2 and clean for gnome1 apps, if
antialiasing is disabled. 
This is difficult to understand for me.

to buy Enron's stock.  While the company piled up debt 
and manufactured imaginary earnings, auditors gave the 
balance sheet a big thumbs-up.  As investors lost 
everything, Enron insiders pocketed millions.
AND THAT should make every investor's blood boil!
Frankly, the Enrons and Global Crossings of the world 
infuriate me.  All the backroom manipulations dirty 
dealing and cover-ups really make it hard to know who 
you can trust.   And that is why we've created a NEW 
investing service, ""David & Tom Gardner's Motley Fool 
Stock Advisor"" -- to bring the Motley Fool co-founders' 
extraordinary commitment to honest stock analysis, 
fair dealing and complete disclosure to investors like 
you on a regular and timely basis.
The Motley Fool, which David and Tom founded back in 
1993, is dedicated to the principle that given the 
right tools...the average guy can find great success in 
every aspect of his financial life.
And now, David and Tom are applying this principle -- and 
their extensive investing experience -- to the new 
""Motley Fool Stock Advisor.""  
But as you'll see, this service isn't just about 
""buying more stocks.""  OUR GOAL in publishing the 
""Motley Fool Stock Advisor"" is twofold:  To help you 
gain the knowledge, confidence and resolve to make 
money in the U.S. stock market...while avoiding the 
biggest mistakes, as well.
The Wall Street analysts touting Global Crossing said 
its worldwide fiber-optics network would make it the 
king of telecom.  Now these shares are WORTH NOTHING.  
Microstrategy was the poster child of the technology 
bubble-after earnings restatements, the stock now sits 
99% OFF its high!  Kmart's lousy inventory management 
and marketing incompetence helped drive the company 
into BANKRUPTCY.
WHAT ABOUT Nortel and Lucent-two of America's most 
widely owned stocks.  Will they ever come back?  How 
about AOL?  Does its merger with Time-Warner mean the 
GLORY DAYS are over -- or have they just begun?   Are 90% 
of all telecommunications companies truly in danger of 
disappearing? If so, which will survive? Will great 
old names like JP Morgan, Disney and Motorola recover?  
Well, those are the sorts of questions David & Tom 
Gardner can help you answer at the ""Motley Fool Stock 
Advisor.""  
As they say, ""Show us the money.""  When it comes to 
making promises, fast-talkers can fudge just about 
anything.  But CASH FLOW doesn't lie.
YOU CAN avoid a lot of big mistakes by simply making 
sure a company has the cash coming in to pay its 
bills.  And watching cash flow is also one of the best 
ways to identify superstar companies -- far more reliable 
than ""earnings"" that can be manipulated 8 ways to 
Sunday.  Once you eliminate big losers from the 
equation -- and target the true superstars -- you'll find 
investing more fun...less stressful...and much more 
profitable, as well.
So forget about Wall Street's ""damaged goods""-
companies that have a boatload of debt and accounting 
woes, as well.  Keep it SIMPLE instead.
""Simple"" means investing in companies that we all -- with 
a little effort -- can understand.  Companies where we 
know what businesses they're really in.  Companies 
where the financial statements actually mean 
something.  And companies easily recognizable as the 
""best of breed.""
In the free report you received, ""The One Stock That 
Keeps Wall Street BUZZING,"" you read about one of 
David & Tom's very favorite investments: Starbucks.  
Before this company came along, most folks just took 
coffee for granted.  And certainly, no one proposed 
any far-reaching business model built around it.  Yet 
these innovators took a low-margin commodity and built 
a near $3 BILLION company with more than 5000 
retail outfits all around the world.
Starbucks has been able to open new outlets based on 
money it has earned from existing ones. That is an 
astounding testament to its economic power.  At The 
Motley Fool Stock Advisor we'll help you find and 
truly understand the great investments, the companies 
with solid balance sheets and real growth prospects.   
Right now we're following companies such as:
*America's most prestigious jeweler -- its brand name 
has no rival.  With net margins of 59% on sales of 
$1.6 Billion, this company is a great pick for solid 
returns with low risk.   
*This software company commands more than 25% of the 
video game market.  Its shares have returned 6,000% 
since its public debut in 1989.  An investment of 
$5,000 in 1989 is now worth over $300,000.  The video 
game market is expected to double by 2005 with this 
company enjoying the lion's share of the growth.
*This premier credit rating company has locked-in 
demand for its reports on the creditworthiness of 
borrowers holding $30 trillion of the world's debt.  
It has a 20-year record of consistent sales and income 
growth and is poised for another stellar year.
YOU CAN TRY the ""Motley Fool Stock Advisor"" for six

Sincerely yours,
Mike Bell, Publisher
""David & Tom Gardner's Motley Fool Stock Advisor""
P.S. Do you like BIG PROFITS?  In 1994, investment 
pros sniffed at America Online's high-flying stock and 
screamed, ""Overvalued.""  But the Gardners saw three 
things they overlooked: 1) AOL was building the 
premier stop in cyberspace; 2) They had a great 
retention strategy; and 3) Millions of members paying 
$$$ every month.
So Tom and David bought it.  And today they're sitting 
on whopping 4,120% gains.  So you see, while they do 
structure their investing strategy to avoid big 
blunders...they do make a lot of money, too.  To try the 
""Motley Fool Stock Advisor"" RISK-FREE, click here now:

Like a growing number of Web surfers, Audrie Krause faces a new uncertainty when she hits the send button on her e-mail these days: Will the message get through?
As the head of a political action group, Krause uses members-only e-mail lists to help educate and organize fellow activists. So she was jarred recently when one message bounced back with a note accusing her of spreading unsolicited junk e-mail, or spam.

Software companies looking for greener pastures are turning to the red, white and blue.
Whether out of heartfelt patriotism in the wake of Sept. 11 or the desire to tap into the nearly $38 billion budgeted for homeland security spending in 2003, many information technology companies that previously paid little attention to government contracts are now going to great lengths to attract government business.

Juniper Networks continues to muddle through the telecom morass.
Juniper beat estimates by earning less than $500,000, reported a 42 percent decline in year-over-year sales and offered little hope that it could grow its business when it reported 2002 second-quarter earnings on Thursday. Yet in some corners of the industry, Juniper's performance was viewed as mildly positive.

Network giant Cisco Systems is installing Aironet wireless LANs into lounges at 19 airports across Europe, targeting business travelers with wireless cards in their laptops or personal digital assistants.
The announcement includes various deals with different telecommunications companies and airports, made under the banner of Cisco Mobile Office, a campaign for wireless LANs (local area networks). The airport deals are at different stages, from a fully fledged paid-for service run by wireless provider Mobynet at Turkey's Ataturk Airport in Istanbul, where the wireless LAN was included when the airport was designed in 1999, to others that are still free trials.

the weekend in the nastiest way, and I am now coughing up dark mucus and doing 
other things that probably don't bear repeating in a public forum. I have the 
10:15 doctor's appointment that I should have made last round, had I not 
convinced myself that &#8220;it's not that bad&#8221; and trudged through it 
all without prescription drugs. I'm not making the same mistake this time. I'll 
be back this afternoon. 
My email problems of yesterday have been resolved. You can once again reach me 
at my normal address, f8dy@diveintomark.org. 
Kevin Burton[1] emailed me with another way to link to a FOAF file from my RSS 
feed. It looks easier than previous suggestions, and it has the advantage of 
being able to use it from an RSS 1.0 or 2.0 feed, but I worry about all these 
variations. Just as in real life, where people can use different words that 
mean essentially the same thing, in the Semantic Web programs can use different 
vocabularies to express the same statements. That's great for producers, not so 
great for consumers who have to make sense of it all. 
For each domain (RSS feeds, FOAF files, whatever), somebody (or some group) 
needs to come along and document best practices. We need better _goal-oriented_ 
documentation. We have a lot of reference documentation, task-oriented 
documentation, but very little that documents that larger picture and answers 
questions written in English. &#8220;How do I include personal information in 
my RSS feed?&#8221; is a goal-oriented question. &#8220;Create a FOAF file 
using this tool and then insert this line at this location in your RSS 
feed&#8221; (with as many examples as necessary) is a goal-oriented answer. 
Anything less is like trying to master a foreign language by reading a 
dictionary.

(It is
amazing what one can achieve when mains power fails, long enough for
UPS's to run out, and all that is left operational is the laptop and
its battery supply...)
First, I put in some defensive code into the area where the problem was
occurring, so that if exmh is attempting (for any reason) to expand a
sequence that isn't either a number, or a range of numbers (or a list of
such things) it will simply ignore the trash, rather than giving a traceback.
This one solves the initial problem:

     set seq {}
     set rseq {}
     foreach range [split [string trim $sequence]] {
+	if ![regexp {^[0-9]+(-[0-9]+)?$} $range] {
+	    # just ignore anything bogus
+	    continue;
+	}
 	set parts [split [string trim $range] -]
 	if {[llength $parts] == 1} {
 	    lappend seq $parts

That is amending proc MhSeqExpand which is where the error was occurring
before (the code assumes that $range is either NNN or NNN-MMM so we should
probably make sure that's true - issue an error instead of just ""continue""
if you like, but I don't think an error is needed).
But that just allowed me to create a similar problem, in another place,
by typing ""NNN-"" ... and rather than continue to fight fires like this,
I thought I should think more about Brent's suggestion.   But rather than
have the selection code actually validate the input, which would mean it
would have to know what is to be valid, I decided that the right thing to
do is just to ignore any errors caused by invalid input, so I just stuck
a ""catch"" around the MsgShow that is processing the nonsense that the
user has typed.
This way, any later expansion to what MsgShow treats as legal (maybe
allowing a sequence name, like ""prev"" or ""next"", or anything else can
be handled just there, without someone needing to remember that they have
to go fix the selection processing code to allow it.
But, while I was playing there, I noticed something I never new before.
If you type ""66+"" the ""66"" changes to ""67"" (and so on, for each + that
is typed).   I suspect that's perhaps an artifact of ""+ is bound to a
different function so it can be used as a toggle between changing the
current and the target folder, but it has to mean something if the current
input mode is a message number, so let it mean..."", but now I found it,
I think its nice.    But if we can type 66+ why not 66- as well?  That
kind of limitation bugs me, so I fixed it.
And then I wondered about folders with names containing '+' - the special
use of + as the toggle character means there's no way to type those from
the keyboard.   So I fixed that as well.   This makes two different
restrictions - there's no way to type a folder name that has a name
beginning with '+' (but such a thing in MH would be a pain to use anyway,
so I doubt this will bother anyone), and it is now only possible to
toggle between typing the current & target folder name when the name
being typed is empty.   I'm less happy about that part, but I think I
can live with it in order to allow folder names with +'s in them to
exist and be typed.
Then, since I was there anyway, I decided to do something about another
feature that has always bugged me.   In ""normal"" keyboard mode, 's' is
the key used to show a message.    But if you've just typed 123, and
the FTOC is highlighting 123 as the current message, and you want to now
show that message, you can't type 's', you have to type \r instead.
So I ""fixed"" this one as well.   ""Fixed"" here is in quotes, as it assumes
that the keybinding for MsgShow is 's', if you change that to something
else, it will remain 's' in here.   I don't know enough tk/tcl to have it
discover what key is bound to a function in the external world in order
to bind the same one here.   \r continues to work of course.
And now I got started in fixing irritants in this code, I also made it
clear the status line if you abort message/folder entry mode (^C or ^G).
Previously it used to leave the prompt sitting there until the next
message appeared, which made it less than obvious that the keyboard had
reverted to its usual bindings.
In any case, what follows is the patch that does all of that.   I believe
that if you apply this, then the one above is probably not needed, the
""catch"" around the ""MsgShow"" will hide the problem (I don't think we really
need to fix Brent's way of invoking it).   Or include it anyway, just
for completeness (I haven't run an exmh with the following patch, but not
the previous one, so I don't know for sure that all will be OK then).

A lot of spam which *appears* to originate from China, and even 
a lot which advertises websites hosted there, is sent by, and is 
done for the benefit of, companies based in the US.  The spam 
often appears to originate there because it's coming from open 
http, or squid proxy servers.  It's hosted there because these 
spammers are now persona-non-grata on all US ISPs.  One hardly 
needs to involve the Chinese government in a case where a US 
citizen is violating US law.

The first court cases were actually concluded years ago. These 
include many legal precedents which are used to protect the 
rights of ISPs to block mail, and to terminate service to 
spammers.

Surprising then, how much information you can find on the 
current whereabouts of long-time spammers like Alan Ralksy of 
Detroit, Michigan.  Ralsky is a guy who even gives interviews to 
the news media.  If you can connect a specific corpus of spam to 
him, his street address is well known. Ralsky is a prime 
candidate for lawsuits in any state with an anti-spam law. 
Thomas Cowles is another long-time spammer, but last I heard 
he'd been jailed for stealing computer equipment from his 
business partner, Eddy Marin (also a long time spammer (You've 
heard of PopLaunch, right?)

Back when I was working at MAPS, there was a flap over a 
pump-and-dump spammer, Rodona Garst.  Seems she had an open 
file-share on her laptop, and when she forged the wrong domain, 
the real owner hacked in and posted all her private information 
on a website. Oh, look, it's still there, including the nude 
photos:
http://belps.freewebsites.com/
I recall this well, because the SEC was VERY interested in 
confirming the validity of the information found online.  There 
were some ""interesting"" conversations. This summer, the SEC 
released the following:
http://www.sec.gov/litigation/admin/33-8113.htm
Yes, the investigation took two years, but the financial penalty 
for operating a pump-and-dump scam isn't small.  The wheels of 
government grind slow, but the grind very fine indeed.

Making a mesh on the move
A new way to give us fast mobile net access spells further trouble for 3G, reports Peter Rojas
Peter Rojas
Thursday August 29, 2002
The Guardian
Imagine being able to surf the net at speeds faster than DSL from 
anywhere, at any time - you could watch a live video webcast while waiting for the bus, email photos to your friends while sitting in the park, or 
download the MP3 of the song that's playing in the pub before it finishes.
This is the vision of a high-speed wireless internet paradise that the 
third-generation (3G) mobile phone companies have been promoting for 
years. 3G services are just beginning to be rolled out, but a new 
technology called mesh networking promises to deliver on this vision 
sooner and more effectively than the mobile phone companies could ever 
dream.
Two companies, US startup MeshNetworks and Moteran Networks of Germany, 
are each developing their own competing version of mesh networking. 
Instead of the current hub-and-spoke model of wireless communications, 
with every device connecting to an overburdened central antenna, any time 
""mesh-enabled"" devices - mobile phones, PDAs, laptops - are in close 
proximity to each other, they automatically create a wireless mesh 
network. Every device in the area acts as a repeater or router, relaying 
traffic for everyone else. Traffic hops from person to person until it 
reaches the nearest internet access point, reducing the need for central 
antennas, and improving wireless coverage.
As the number of mobile phones soars, and wireless PDAs, laptops, and 
other devices begin to crowd the spectrum, this approach to wireless 
networking may be inevitable.
Mesh networks also have several other advantages over 3G wireless 
networks. While 3G operators roll out mobile services that offer users 
connection speeds of up to 144 kbps (roughly three times faster than a 
dial-up modem), Moteran and MeshNetworks are able to offer connection 
speeds of up to 6Mbps, over a hundred times faster than dial-up. The 
technologies they use include Wi-Fi - the emerging standard for high-speed wireless networking also known as 802.11b. A similarly short-range 
protocol called UltraWideBand, which is poised to succeed Wi-Fi, is even 
faster and could, by 2005, approach 400 Mbps.
The range of a typical Wi-Fi network is generally too limited to be of 
much use when travelling around a city. Mesh networks get around the 
problem of coverage by having every device in the network relay traffic. 
Even though the range of any individual device is relatively small, 
because (in theory) there will be so many users in the surrounding area, 
connections will be faster and better than that of a standard 3G wireless 
connection.
Because mesh networks use Wi-Fi, the equipment and infrastructure needed 
to create them is cheap and readily available. Instead of building 
cellular phone towers that often cost hundreds of thousands of pounds, all that is needed to get a network going are wireless access points (around 
100 now) placed strategically around town to relay traffic, and the 
proper software. Existing laptops and PDAs can be mesh-enabled by 
software.
It also means that anyone could set up their own mobile phone network. 
Unlike with 3G cellular, the part of the spectrum that Wi-Fi operates on 
is unregulated in the US, Britain. The mobile phone companies are none too pleased about this, especially since many of them spent billions of pounds acquiring 3G licences.
All that's needed are cheap relays and mobile phones equipped to connect 
to the network. With every additional customer that signs up coverage gets better, instead of getting worse, as is the case with mobile phone 
networks.
But things get very interesting when you realise that when you have 
high-speed internet connections everywhere, and everyone's laptops, PDAs, 
and mobile phones are connected together at blazingly fast speeds, sharing music, movies, or whatever else becomes ridiculously easy. When 
UltraWideBand hits, all of this will just accelerate.
At 400Mbps, copying a pirated copy of the Lord of the Rings from the 
person sitting across from you at the cafe would take about 15 seconds. 
Sooner or later, playgrounds will be filled with kids swapping files of 
their favourite songs, movies, and video games.
But the first mesh networks are not likely to be available to consumers. 
MeshNetworks has no plans to offer its own high-speed wireless service. 
Instead the company plans to sell its technology to others, such as cities that want to provide wireless internet to police, fire, and public works 
employees, or businesses that want to establish wireless networks on the 
cheap. Moteran has similar aspirations for small businesses and for 
enterprise networks.
The first place average users may use the technology is when it is 
incorporated into vehicles, enabling motorists to access the internet at 
high speeds, which both companies see happening soon.
When will you be able to wander around town with a 6Mbps connection in 
your pocket? It's too soon to say, but just as broadband internet service 
was initially available only to businesses and universities, eventually 
someone will see the profit in bringing mesh networking to the masses.",ham

Works like a charm. It's like the box was on drugs or something. 
However, while testing it a selected my favourite folder (l-k) and 
marked ~400 messages unread. THAT took forever, or about as long as 
Catch-up Unseen did before. Any suggestions?

  Sun Micro Outlines Roadmap for Managing Networks 
  Friday September 20, 5:00 am ET 
  By Peter Henderson 
  SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - Computer maker Sun Microsystems Inc. on Thursday
  said it would create in a few years a network environment that will be as
  straightforward to handle as a single machine, a strategy it calls N1.
  It laid out a road map for a new layer of intelligent software and systems that will meld
  unwieldy networks into easy-to-use systems, a goal similar to those of most rivals
  making computers which manage networks. 
  EMC Corp. announced this week software aimed at allowing users to manage storage
  resources as a pool. Hewlett-Packard Co has a Utility Data Center, designed for
  broader management. International Business Machines Corp's project eLiza is working
  to make computers ""self-healing"" when systems break.
  ""Applications still have to run zeroes and ones on some computing engine but the
  whole idea behind N1 is you stop thinking about that. You don't think about what box
  it is running on,"" Sun Vice President Steve MacKay, head of the N1 program, said in an
  interview on the sidelines of a Sun user conference. 
  Many industry executives see computer power eventually being sold like power or
  water, as a utility that can be turned on or off, in whatever volume one wants whenever
  needed. 
  For that to happen computers must be tied together seamlessly, rather than cobbling
  them together with tenuous links, as most networks do today, experts say. There are
  still major barriers, though, such as communications standards for machines from
  different vendors to interoperate closely. 
  Sun promised to deliver a ""virtualization engine"" that would let administrators look at
  their entire network as a pool by the end of the year. Network administrators today
  often have no automatic system to report what is in the network. 
  ""It'll tell you what you have and how it is laid out,"" promised MacKay
  The second stage, beginning in 2003, would allow users to identify a service, such as
  online banking, and allocate resources for them with a few clicks, Sun said. 
  Finally, in 2004, Sun's software should allow networks to change uses of resources on
  the fly in response to changing needs, such as a bank assuring quicker online response
  time for priority users, the company said.",ham

Errrr....the biz guys in my office don't care what the ""WISPs"" want to do
with their little WiFi networks.  And the bandwidth shadows in most cities
are surprisingly large and common.  They aren't selling the software, which
is pretty pricy as it happens.  They are using it to optimize next
generation wireless canopies over metro areas and fiber networks on a large
scale.  There are an essentially infinite number of metro wireless
configurations, some of which generate far more dead or marginal spots and
others which are very expensive to operate (due to backhaul transit
considerations) or both.  This software can be used as a tool to optimize
the canopy coverage and minimize the actual transit costs since the wireless
is tied into fiber at multiple points.
The canopies we are talking about aren't short-range wifi technologies, but
a mixture of long-range high-performance wireless networking, with bandwidth
measured in tens to hundreds of mbits and ranges measured in miles (up to
well over a hundred miles on the extreme end).  At those ranges and
bandwidth levels, the cost of providing the network can easily vary by an
order of magnitude or more depending on how you manage RF shadows and
proximity to fiber access points.  The idea ultimately is to optimize the
cost and performance such that no existing network infrastructure providers
can remotely compete and maintain profitability.  This is a surprisingly low
bar, and it is about time networks were designed with this level of
large-scale optimization (cost per mbit, maximizing coverage, and effective
bandwidth available per unit area) in any case.  And for this company's
long-term plans, this type of capability will be absolutely necessary to
keep things sane.
Or at least investors find this capability very sexy and compelling,
especially since we have this lovely visualization engine tied into the
system (CLI batches never have the same effect, even if it is more
efficient).

between Roman Chariots and the Space Shuttle. It has the ring of something 
apocraphyl to me, but it's a good read, nevertheless. 
    The U.S. standard railroad gauge (distance between the rails) is 4 feet, 
    8.5 inches. That is an exceedingly odd number. Why was that gauge used? 
    Because that's the way they built them in England, and the U.S. railroads 
    were built by English expatriates. 
    Why did the English build them that way? Because the first rail lines were 
    built by the same people who built the pre-railroad tramways, and that's 
    the gauge they used. 
    Why did ""they"" use that gauge? Because the people who built the tramways 
    used the same jigs and tools that they used for building wagons, which used 
    that wheel spacing. 
    So why did the wagons have that particular odd spacing? Well, if they tried 
    to use any other spacing, the wagon wheels would break on some of the old, 
    long distance roads in England, because that was the spacing of the wheel 
    ruts...

 Just to solve this...the reason I was booting the box with
root=/dev/hda5, not /dev/md0 was because /dev/md0 wasn't booting - it
would barf with 'can't find init'.
 It turns out that this is because I was populating md0 with tar. Which
seems to have 'issues' with crosslinked files - for instance, it was
trying to make a hard link of glibc.so to hda - and failing. It was only
as I did it again with a friend present, that he spotted the errors, and
queried them. We noticed that the hard linked files just didn't exist on
the new rootfs.
 When we duplicated the filesystems with dump instead of tar, it worked
fine, I was able to tell lilo to use root=/dev/md0 and everything worked.
 Woohoo.

Steve Nordquist <signa@birch.net>,interested@amiga.com,fork@spamassassin.taint.org,,,,,unsubscribe,UAE/Ami*/Linux Laptop:  Important details.,<20020910055423.096E829409A@xent.com>,"Well, for one, it would free up the similar laptop I already got to
just run Amithlon (or if that wasn't so fun, bsd) to run just OpenBSD!
This is a near-term thing I could look forward to!
However, an 'official' laptop seems unexciting to me with only
the items mentioned.  Most important are the particulars distinguishing
the listed spec from a Dell 2650, preferably:
1- GeForce4 440 Go or newer, pleasingly modern GPU; the
   GeForce2Go (with 16MB video RAM; too little) I have is
   not so much too slow as inefficient; with factory settings it would
   actually crash from running too hot and too fast.
   (Accelerating the Ami* and possibly OpenUAE graphics
   is a necessity to meet for good speed in those environments,
   but an energy-efficient GPU is a good sideeffect and
    portability (read: battery lifetime) enabler.)
1.5- Great control over CPU state; by use of 'internet keys'
    wired to BIOS/bhipset routines directly or preferably a scroll
    wheel.  Also, hibernate that works, please.
1.7- Bootable to USB 2.0 drives (e.g. larger external ones)
    in BIOS, please.
2- P4 Dells overheat.  They have a big heatsink and a little fan
   to pull air through it, and if you don't elevate thelaptop off
   the desk or table or bed it's on, the fan will -stay- on.  Not good
  for MTBS (mean time between service; unless you've got an
  angle on making money on service from Amigans.....)
     One excellent solution is to include a heatpipe which runs
  behind the AMLCD, thus using the backside of the display
  half as a radiator.; though it interferes with the case notion
  below.  (yes, Aavid or such makes some as a standard part.)
      I prefer to include the heatpipe but employ the radiative
  mass in elevating the laptop (i.e. in the form of a catch-handle
  and second logo device behind the laptop, which generally
  provides stow and attachment for elevation legs (move them
  out farther to get to the next-higher ekevation, until the sides
  of the laptop are met.)  This also happens to provide a little
  protection for USB 2  and 1394 cables that I tend to keep
  plugged in all the time (a bit longer port life? Please.) 
3- A case color other than brown or black, and preferably (if the
    display module NRE is entirely permissive) the capability to
    -run with the backlight off.-  Again, to save battery power, but
    also as a feature; maybe you remember the iBooks modified
   in this manner.  The user has the privilege to pull out the
   backlight diffuser and fiberoptic lightpipe/CF assembly, with
   its backreflector, and the whole warrantee.  This provides
   for excellent outdoor use, often with the diffuser reinserted
   to keep depth-of-field distractions minimised.
     What would I like?  A1200 putty color, any translucency,
   in or over a rosewood-colored (in KDE color browser, I see
   chocolate, firebrick and a couple of 'indian red' that are great
   candidates) base.  
      I would also like to be able to at least turn off the backlight
    without closing the lid, and to be -able- to fit an -external-
    light source such as a UV-filtered solar collector (and glare
    hood) to feed
    into the backlight.  Not only does this make an excellent 
    color environment but lets one work outdoors tolerably.
      The logo should be a coloration of a
   minimal surface, as the MAA is trying to get me to renew
   with:  demos at http://astronomy.swin.edu.au/pbourke/geometry/
   at first blush.  We'll see what comes out of the contest and
   maybe you'll like the mapping MathCAD does of the
   logo to a minimal surface or manifold that reflects the
   openness of AmigaOS, Ami* and Amiga community.
   MAA.org has more references, I'm sure.
4- Obviously Elfin details., e,g, the backlight inlet.
Other details:
USB2.x preferred; FireWire would be needed if that's unavailable.
Options like 802.11b or attabhable WiFi hub for ethernet port
should round out the offering.  An option for just-released 
.13 micron P4 (with mobile power features) could make more
reviewers greenlight the series; much better power consumption,
and almost certainly a higher a top clock come with that.
CompactFlash, SmartMedia and MMC flash memory card
interfaces would be very pleasant.  I've mentioned booting to
USB, and booting from CF would be a pleasant extigency also.
To that end, a backup solution with compression using
USB 2 storage or the multimode drive is always a nice 
bundle item; that or a chance to back out a patch under 3 OS.....

Blue skies (and clear water and fresh air): 
Waterproof to 30 feet, 3 Ethernet ports plus onboard WiFi.
Svelte; 3-line frontpanel LCD and bright red pager LED,
builtin G4 cellphone functions, choice of side and 
frontpanel trim: Ivory-like stuff inscribed with M68k memory map
and various OS 3.9 structures or textured fur that
says 'This is Amiga Speaking' when stroked 'round. 
Decent keyboard, as in Toshiba or IBM laptops; perhaps 
an ergonomic fingerworks.com device (they work as 
keyboard and mouse) as the keyboard/trackpad.
2 Directional planar mics atop AMLCD; soundcard with multiple 
18 bit A-D and noise reduction DSP that work in our
(second-through-fourth, at least) favorite OS.
Actual 7"" bellows pulls out at nominal ventilation 
fan location for real void-comp (the test in Blade
Runner) style cooling and extended bass; active cooling
and airfiltering is available to adjust humidity at user
seat and provide mineral water.

in an old Dublin song, which in turn was mentioned in a Pogues track.  Billy
was a legless beggar in the alleys of Stoneybatter and Grangegorman (where I
now live) during the 18th century, who discovered a new, but not entirely
legal, way to make money.
BlogEnd: 
LinkText: Billy in the Bowl
From:         daev <hellshaw@fringeware.com>
Subject:      The Case of the Stoneybatter Strangler
A story of my new neighbourhood...

The Irish Digest July 1964

The Case of the Stoneybatter Strangler
The handsome, deformed Billy in the Bowl evolved a plan to rob his donors.
Then, one night, he made the biggest mistake of his life 
DUBLIN in the eighteenth century was noted for two things - the
architectural beauty of its public buildings and the large number of
beggars who sought alms in its maze of streets and lanes.  Many of these
beggars relied on visitors and the gentry for their coin, but there was one
who campaigned among the working class.  This was ""Billy In The Bowl""
The strange appellation was derived from the fact that Billy's sole means
of transport was a large bowl-shaped car with wheels.  Seated in this ""
bowl "", the beggar would propel himself along by pushing against the ground
with wooden plugs, one in each hand.
Billy's unusual means of conveyance was vitally necessary, as he had been
born without legs.  Nature, however, had compensated for this by endowing
him with powerful arms and shoulders and, what was most important, an
unusually handsome face.
This was Billy's greatest asset in his daily routine of separating
sympathetic passers-by from their small change.
The cunning young beggar would wait at a convenient spot on one of the many
lonely roads or lanes which were a feature of eighteenth century
Grangegorman and Stoneybatter, until a servant girl or an old lady would
come along.
He would then put on is most attractive smile which, together with his
black curly hair, never failed to halt the females.  The fact that such a
handsome young man was so terribly handicapped physically always evoked pity.
""Billy in the Bowl"", however, wasn't satisfied with becoming the daily
owner of a generous number of small coins; what his greed demanded were
substantial sums of money.  The more he managed to get the more he could
indulge in his pet vices - gambling and drinking.
As a result the beggar evolved a plan to rob unsuspecting sympathisers.
The first time lie put his plan into operation was on a cold March evening
as dusk, was falling.  The victim was a middle aged woman who was passing
through Grangegorman Lane on her way to visit friends in Queen Street - on
Dublin's North Quays.
When Billy heard the woman's footsteps, he hid behind some bushes in a
ditch which skirted the lane.  As his unsuspecting victim drew close, the
beggar moaned and shouted, and cried out for help.
Trembling with excitement, the woman dashed to the spot where Billy lay
concealed.  She bent down to help the beggar out of the ditch, when two
powerful arms closed around her throat and pulled her into the bushes.
In a few minutes it was all over.  The woman lay in a dead faint, and Billy
was travelling at a fast rate down the lane in his "" bowl "", his victirn's
purse snug in his coat pocket.  An hour after the robbery the woman was
found in a distracted condition, but failed to give a description of her
assailant.  And, as ""Billy in the Bowl"" had figured, nobody would suspect a
deformed beggar.
Again and again the beggar carried out his robbery plan, always shifting
the place of attack to a different part of Grangegorman or  Stoneybatter.
On one occasion "" Billy in ""the Bowl "" tried his tactics on a sturdy
servant girl who put up such a vigorous resistance that he was forced to
strangle her.  The incident became known as the 11 Grangegorman Lane Murder
and caused a great stir.
Hundred.s flocked to the scene of the crime and for a couple of months
""Billy in the Bowl"" was forced to desert his usual haunts.  Around this
period, Dublin's first-ever police force was been mobilised, and the first
case they were confronted with was the Grangegorman lane murder.
Months passed and  ""Billy in the Bowl"" reverted once again to his old
pasttime.  A number of young servant girls were lured into ditches and
robbed, and the police were inundated with so many complaints that a
nightly patrol was placed on the district.  But the beggar still rolled
along in his ""bowl"" pitied and unsuspected.  Then came the night that
finished Billy's career of crime.
Two stoudy built female cooks, trudging back to their places of employment
after a night out in the city, were surprised and not a little shocked to
hear shouts for help.  Rushing over, they came upon a huddled figure in the
ditch.
Billy, thinking there was only one woman, grabbed one of the cooks and
tried to pull her into the ditch.  She proved much too strong for him,
however) and while resisting tore 'at his face with her sharp finger-nails.
Meanwhile, her companion acted with speed and daring.  Pulling out her
large hatpin she made .for the beggar, and plunged the pin into his right eye.
The screams and howls of the wounded beggar reverberated throughout the
district and brought people dashing to the scene.  Among them was a member
of the nightly police patrol who promptly arrested the groaning Billy.
""Billy in the Bowl"" was tried and sentenced for robbery with violence, but
they could never prove it was he who had strangled the servant girl.  The
Grangegorman-Stoneybatter district became once again a quiet, attractive
Dublin suburb where old ladies strolled, and carefree servant girls laughed
and giggled as they wended their way home at night.

I don't think gpg signing my repositories will help anything, as it will
just ensure that my passphrase was typed to confirm the md5 signatures of
all pgklists and srclists. Basically, you'll then just be sure that it's me
who generated the files, and this will of course prevent automating the
process of updating the apt repository when Red Hat updates show up.
In Red Hat Linux 8.0 though, the warnings about ""No Key"" appear until you
import the right gpg public keys directly with rpm, for example :
rpm --import /usr/share/doc/apt-0.5.4cnc7/RPM-GPG-KEY
(this will import my key, which is used to sign all freshrpms.net packages)
Hopefully it is possible to the tell rpm to install *only* packages who
verify against an imported gpg key? This for me would be the optimal way to
ensure integrity with the way things curently work.

That's just apt's way of telling you the package is in ""AllowDuplicated"", 
meaning multiple versions of the package can be installed at the same 
time. Yes the output is a bit strange.. especially when there's only one 
version available.
'apt-get install kernel-source#2.4.18-3' will install it...

Just for the record mc has a nice directory
comparison function. This is really nice
when using the ftp VFS for e.g. Of course
if you use something like ftpfs you can use

FWIW, I would now recommend doing this (using a user with a procmailrc)
instead of a system alias; more secure, and easier to filter out crud
like bounces, virii etc. that render a corpus dirty.

DVDs don't use trusted hardware. As for whether it is worth it, that 
depends entirely on what its worth to secure your software.

Well, in sylheed's ""claws"" branch you need to wait a bit for the developers
to backport all the updates from the main branch before getting a release
with the same version number.
Right now, the latest ""claws"" release is still 0.8.2claws :

But as it's the primary mailer I use, you can be sure that as soon as it's
updated to 0.8.3, I'll update my build! :-)

You could build your own apt-repository. Just mirror the needed directories
(e.g. by using a wget cron job), symlink the needed rpms and recreate the
repository. It is already worth the trouble, if you have more than one
installation.
In any case in order to acces the mentioned places, somebody must keep such a
repository up to date, be it yourself or someone else.

That sounds like fun. But it sets the wrong precedent.
Here's the better idea. Invite her for an afternoon
cruise under the Golden Gate bridge in your Stonehorse
day sailor. Under way, ask her if she'd like to take
the stick. Back at slip, cook her dinner. Something
simple, but good, maybe a stir fry or a stew, served
in the cockpit, with an inexpensive but potable wine.
If she runs away after that, 'tis good riddance. If
she wants to try it again, another day, she shows
promise. If she asks you to show her the V berth, you
have a girlfriend. If she notes your brightwork needs
another coat, and asks what you're using on it,
propose on the spot.

think about deployment.
Eventually, individuals and postmasters should be able to download a
spambayes software distribution, answer a few configuration questions
about their mail setup, training and false positives, and install it
as a filter.
A more modest initial goal might be the production of a tool that can
easily be used by individuals (since we're more likely to find
individuals willing to risk this than postmasters).
There are many ways to do this.  Some ideas:
- A program that acts both as a pop client and a pop server.  You
  configure it by telling it about your real pop servers.  You then
  point your mail reader to the pop server at localhost.  When it
  receives a connection, it connects to the remote pop servers, reads
  your mail, and gives you only the non-spam.  To train it, you'd only
  need to send it the false negatives somehow; it can assume that
  anything is ham that you don't say is spam within 48 hours.
- A server with a custom protocol that you send a copy of a message
  and that answers ""spam"" or ""ham"".  Then you have a little program
  that is invoked e.g. by procmail that talks to the server.  (The
  server exists so that it doesn't have to load the pickle with the
  scoring database for each message.  I don't know how big that pickle
  would be, maybe loading it each time is fine.  Or maybe
  marshalling.)
- Your idea here.
Takers?  How is ESR's bogofilter packaged?  SpamAssassin?  The Perl
Bayes filter advertised on slashdot?

Don't use bsddb in a closed-source product.  Use dbm or dumdbm or use
pickles or roll your own thang.  I doubt the presence of bsddb would be the
only barrier to creating a closed-source product based upon the spambayes
code.

A.K. Dewdney was the name I was looking for and the column was ""Computer 
Recreations"". Turns out he's still in Ontario and even has some homemade

 Try installing the latest Perl (at least 5.6.1) port on Freebsd and make
sure you set the system to use perl from ports (i.e. in the
ports/lang/perl5/files directory run ./use.perl port. Reinstall the relevant
perl modules needed by razor and try again.

joelonsoftware <rssfeeds@spamassassin.taint.org>,yyyy@spamassassin.taint.org,,,,,,no-unsubscribe,Feedback from my posting about FogBUGZ Setup fell into four    categories. *,<200210090800.g9980eK25205@dogma.slashnull.org>,"Feedback from my posting[1] about FogBUGZ[2] Setup fell into four categories. 
*""Why make Setup reversable? Instead you should collect all the information 
from the user and make all the changes in one batch at the end.""* There are a 
couple of things to understand here. First of all, even if you do everything in 
one batch at the end, there's always a possibility that some step in the middle 
of the batch will fail, and in that case, a well-behaved setup program will 
back out the steps that were already done. There are well over 100 error 
messages in the string table for FogBUGZ Setup so the number of things that can 
fail is not insignificant. 
Second, it's not nice to tell people about an error in their input three pages 
after they made the mistake. For example, early in the FogBUGZ setup process we 
prompt you to create an account for FogBUGZ to use: 
[IMG: http://www.joelonsoftware.com/pictures/setupNewAcct.gif (FogBUGZ Setup 
Screenshot)] 
The account creation could fail for a myriad of reasons, none of which can be 
predicted before trying to create the account. For example, the password might 
not conform to the system password policy. And different national versions of 
Windows NT have different rules about accented letters in passwords (betcha 
didn't know that!). It's better to tell the user about this problem right away 
so they can correct their input rather than having a message come up during the 
long install process later, forcing the user to back up and fix it. And even if 
you force the user to back up and fix it, you still have to undo the first part 
of the work that you did before creating the account, otherwise you've left 
their system in an indeterminate state. 
In any case I need to write code to create the account and delete the account 
in case something later fails; I might as well call that code on this page of 
the wizard where I can display a useful error message. 
And what are the kinds of things that need to be reversable? Well, in order to 
upgrade FogBUGZ without requiring a reboot (and we _never, ever _require a 
reboot), we have to shut down a couple of processes that might have been 
keeping FogBUGZ files pinned down, such as IIS (Microsoft's web server). So 
part one of the batch is ""Stop IIS."" Now if part 2 fails for some reason, it 
would be _extremely_ rude to leave IIS not running. And anyway, it's not like I 
don't need to write the code for ""Start IIS"" for the end of the batch. So the 
code to rollback ""Stop IIS"" is already written. No big deal, I just need to 
call it at the right place. 
I think one reason that people think you should ""gather all the info and then 
do all the work"" is because with very large installation programs that are very 
slow, this is a polite way to waste less of the user's time. Indeed even 
FogBUGZ setup does 95% of its work at the very end. But the ""create account"" 
operation is so fast, that principle simply doesn't apply here. Even our 95% of 
the work phase takes well under a minute, most of which is spent waiting for 
IIS to stop and start. 
*""Why did you use VC++/MFC? Surely an advanced intelligence such as yourself 
has admitted by now that Delphi[3] is more productive.""* First of all, leave 
your language religious fanaticism at the Usenet door. Somehow I managed 
to figure out_ in high school_ that language advocacy and religious 
arguments are unbelievably boring.  
Secondly, even if Delphi were more productive, the only pertinent question, 
since I am writing the code, is _what is more productive for Joel Spolsky_. And 
I don't know Delphi at all, but I know Win32, MFC, and VC++ _really, really 
well_. So while I might not outcode a good Delphi programmer, I would 
definitely outcode a completely inexperienced Delphi programmer (which is me), 
certainly over a short 4 week project. Third, many of the things I needed to do 
in this setup program are things like ""grant the Logon as Service privilege to 
an account."" This is rare enough that the only way to find out how to do this 
is to search the Microsoft knowlege base and the web in general. When you 
search the web in general for how to do fancy things with Windows NT, what you 
find is about 75% C code, maybe 20% VB code, and 5% everything else. Yes, I 
know, I could translate the C code into Delphi (assuming I was a sophisticated 
Delphi programmer, not a completely inexperienced Delphi programmer), but that 
costs as much productivity as I would supposedly gain from your supposedly more 
productive programming language. And fourth, I already had about 30% of the 
code I needed for Setup in MFC format: from FogBUGZ 2.0 Setup, and a library 
I've been using for years to make wizards. 
*""Why make Setup at all? You already have your customers' money. Good Setup 
programs don't increase sales.""* This was actually the smartest question and 
made me think the hardest. I came up with three reasons: 
- Decreased tech support cost. This setup program will pay for itself over the 
life of the code. 
- Delight my customers. When I'm trying to get them to upgrade to 4.0, I want 
them to remember how painless the 3.0 installation was, so they won't hesitate 
because they are afraid to upgrade. I'm still using an old version of 
SpamAssassin that is becoming increasingly ineffective, even though I know the 
new version is much better, because I just can't bear the thought of another 
morning wasted. The very memory of the first SpamAssassin installation -- all 
the little SSH windows, some su'ed, trying to scroll through man pages and 
Google Groups, accidentally hitting Ctrl+Z in Emacs to undo and having it 
suspend, trying to guess why we can't get the MTA to run procmail, sorry it's 
too much. If SpamAssassin was making money off of upgraders they would have 
lost my business because they don't have a SETUP program. 
- Win reviews. Software reviewers always cast about for some kind of 
standardized way to rate software, even when they are comparing apples and 
oranges and planets and 17th century philosophers. They always have a 
meaningless list of things to review which can be applied to PC games, 
mainframe databases, web site auction software, and DNA sequencing 
software. And Setup is always on their list. A single flaw in setup is 
guaranteed to be mentioned in every review because every reviewer will see it 
and say ""Aha!""

*""How can we make WISE[4] better?"" *Kudos to the product manager of WISE 
Installation System for calling me up and listening to my litany of all the 
reasons his product wasn't adequate for typical IIS/ASP/SQL applications.

Yes, I looked at ""fixing"" it there, but that code is really quite
general, with almost no understanding of what anything means, so I
didn't think that corrupting it with knowlwedge of the semantics of
what it is fetching would really be the best thing to do.
I ran out of time last night while looking for a better place for
a similar check (I would have gone directly to the regexp - I'm not
that up to date with all the latest tcl changes...) and I'm not sure
I will have time today, but I will keep looking.

Nope, this is ""normal"" as Red Hat removed all mp3 support from 8.0 because
of patent and royalty issues :-(
On freshrpms.net, you can find the xmms mp3 plugin as I said, but also
libmad, lame (mp3 encoder), and soon mpg321 as I often used it myself.
Many other players can also play mp3 files, like alsaplayer, xine, mplayer.

This is not normal though...
Try ""mplayer -vo help"" then try usinf various output methods to see if some
do work or not.

Content-management vendor Documentum said late Thursday it plans to acquire
privately held e-Room Technologies in a deal worth about $100 million.
Documentum will issue approximately 7.7 million shares of its common stock
and pay about $12.6 million in cash for all of the outstanding shares of
eRoom.
Documentum makes a platform for enterprise-wide content management. ERoom
makes tools for enterprise collaboration. Its customers include Airbus,
Bausch & Lomb, Ford Motor Co., and Sony.
Documentum announced plans this summer to deliver a new Collaboration
Edition of its content-management suite. ERoom was already integrating its
tools to the Documentum platform, making an acquisition an easy target,
according to Documentum president and CEO Dave DeWalt.
With the upcoming joint product, customers will be able to collaborate in
real-time via virtual workspaces, sharing schedules, resources, and even
jointly creating content.
Content creation and management has always been a collaborative task, but
workflow has usually been delivered via a Web browser interface or even
simple e-mail -- and rarely in real-time.
For now, Documentum will sell the eRoom platform and its own
content-management system through combined sales channels. Further
integration is planned down the line, the companies said.",ham

PARENTS OF 15 - YEAR OLD - FIND $71,000 CASH HIDDEN IN
HIS CLOSET!
Does this headline look familiar? Of course it does. You most likely have
just seen this story recently featured on a major nightly news program (USA).
And reported elsewhere in the world (including my neck of the woods -
New Zealand). His mother was cleaning and putting laundry away when
she came across a large brown paper bag that was suspiciously buried
beneath some clothes and a skateboard in the back of her 15-year-old
sons closet. Nothing could have prepared her for the shock she got when
she opened the bag and found it was full of cash. Five-dollar bills, twenties,
fifties and hundreds - all neatly rubber-banded in labelled piles.
""My first thought was that he had robbed a bank"", says the 41-year-old
woman, ""There was over $71,000 dollars in that bag --that's more than my
husband earns in a year"".
The woman immediately called her husband at the car-dealership where
he worked to tell him what she had discovered.He came home right away
and they drove together to the boys school and picked him up.  Little did
they suspect that where the money came from was more shocking than
actually finding it in the closet.
As it turns out, the boy had been sending out, via E-mail, a type of 
""Report"" to E-mail addresses that he obtained off the Internet. Everyday
after school for the past 2 months, he had been doing this right on his
computer in his bedroom.
""I just got the E-mail one day and I figured what the heck, I put my name
on it like the instructions said and I started sending it out"", says the clever
15-year-old.
The E-mail letter listed 5 addresses and contained instructions to send one
$5 dollar bill to each person on the list, then delete the address at the top
and move the others addresses Down , and finally to add your name to
the top of the list.
The letter goes on to state that you would receive several thousand
dollars in five-dollar bills within 2 weeks if you sent out the letter with your
name at the top of the 5-address list. ""I get junk E-mail all the time, and
really did not think it was going to work"", the boy continues.
Within the first few days of sending out the E-mail, the Post Office Box
that his parents had gotten him for his video-game magazine subscriptions
began to fill up with not magazines, but envelopes containing $5 bills.
""About a week later I rode [my bike] down to the post office and my box
had 1 magazine and about 300 envelops stuffed in it. There was also a
yellow slip that said I had to go up to the [post office] counter. I thought I
was in trouble or something (laughs)"". He goes on, ""I went up to the
counter and they had a whole box of more mail for me. I had to ride back
home and empty out my backpack because I could not carry it all"".  Over
the next few weeks, the boy continued sending out the E-mail.""  The
money just kept coming in and I just kept sorting it and stashing it in the
closet, barely had time for my homework"".He had also been riding his bike
to several of the banks in his area and exchanging the $5 bills for twenties, 
fifties and hundreds.
""I didn't want the banks to get suspicious so I kept riding to different banks
with like five thousand at a time in my backpack. I would usually tell the
lady at the bank counter that my dad had sent me in to exchange the
money] and he was outside waiting for me.One time the lady gave me a
really strange look and told me that she would not be able to do it for me
and my dad would have to come in and do it, but I just rode to the next
bank down the street (laughs).""  Surprisingly, the boy did not have any
reason to be afraid.The reporting news 
team examined and investigated the so-called ""chain-letter"" the boy was
sending out and found that it was not a chain-letter at all.In fact, it was
completely legal according to US Postal and Lottery Laws, Title 18,
Section 1302 and 1341, or Title 18, Section 3005 in the US code, also in
the code of federal regulations, Volume 16, Sections 255 and 436, which
state a product or service must be exchanged for money received.
Every five-dollar bill that he received contained a little note that read,
""Please send me report number XYX"".This simple note made the letter
legal because he was exchanging a service (A Report on how-to) for a 
five-dollar fee.
[This is the end of the media release. If you would like to understand how
the system works and get your $71,000 - please continue reading. What 
appears below is what the 15 year old was sending out on the net -
 YOU CAN USE IT TOO - just follow the simple instructions].
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
BE FINANCIALLY FREE LIKE OTHERS WITHIN A YEAR!!! Before you
say ""Bull"", please read the following. This is the letter you have been
hearing about on the news lately. Due to the popularity of this letter on the
 Internet, a national weekly news program recently devoted an entire
show to the investigation of this program described below, to see if it really
can make people money. The show also investigated whether or not the
program was legal. Their findings proved once and for all that there are
""absolutely NO Laws prohibiting the participation in the program and if
people can follow the simple instructions, they are bound to make some
megabucks with only $25 out of pocket cost"".

DUE TO THE RECENT INCREASE OF POPULARITY & RESPECT THIS
PROGRAM HAS ATTAINED, IT IS CURRENTLY WORKING BETTER
THAN EVER.

Note* follow the directons below, I had best results the second time when
I hired a bulk email service in addition to following the reports instructions.
In order for all of us to be successful, many, many emails must be sent so
that the returns are many. I have been extremely successful using the
following company. They send out the offers, and all I do is accept money
for reports, then I send back to the people as soon as possible.
This is what one had to say: ""Thanks to this profitable opportunity. I was 
approached many times before but each time I passed on it. I am so glad I
finally joined just to see what one could expect in return for the minimal
effort and money required. To my astonishment, I received total
$610,470.00 in 21 weeks, with money still coming in"".
Pam Hedland, Fort Lee, New Jersey.
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
Here is another testimonial: ""This program has been around for a long time 
but I never believed in it. But one day when I received this again in the
mail I decided to gamble my $25 on it. I followed the simple instructions
and walaa ..... 3 weeks later the money started to come in. First month I
only made $240.00 but the next 2 months after that I made a total of
$290,000.00. So far, in the past 8 months by re-entering the program, I
have made over $710,000.00 and I am playing it again. The key to
success in this program is to follow the simple steps and NOT change
anything."" More testimonials later but first,
PRINT THIS NOW FOR YOUR FUTURE REFERENCE
++++ Order all 5 reports shown on the list below +++
For each report, send $5 CASH, THE NAME & NUMBER OF THE 
REPORT YOU ARE ORDERING and YOUR E-MAIL ADDRESS to the
person whose name appears ON THAT LIST next to the report. MAKE
SURE YOUR RETURN ADDRESS IS ON YOUR ENVELOPE TOP LEFT
 CORNER in case of any mail problems.
 When you place your order, make sure you order each of the 5 reports.
You will need all 5 reports so that you can save them on your computer.
Within a few days you will receive, vie e-mail, each of the 5 reports from
these 5 different individuals. Save them on your computer so they will be
accessible for you to send to the 1,000's of people who will order them from
you. Also make a floppy of these reports and keep it on your desk in case
something happens to your computer.

IMPORTANT - DO NOT alter the names of the people who are listed next
to each report, or their sequence on the list, in any way other than what is
instructed below in step ""1 through 6"" or you will loose out on majority of
your profits. Once you understand the way this works, you will also see
how it does not work if you change it. Remember, this method has been
tested, and if you alter, it will NOT work!!! People have tried to put their
friends/relatives names on all five thinking they could get all the money.
But it does not work this way. Believe us, we all have tried to be greedy
and then nothing happened. So Do Not try to change anything other than
what is instructed. Because if you do, it will not work for you. Remember,
honesty reaps the reward!!!

1.... After you have ordered all 5 reports, take this advertisement and
REMOVE the name & address of the person in REPORT # 5. This person
has made it through the cycle and is no doubt counting their fortune.
2.... Move the name & address in REPORT # 4 down TO REPORT #5.
3.... Move the name & address in REPORT # 3 down TO REPORT #4.
4.... Move the name & address in REPORT # 2 down TO REPORT #3.
5.... Move the name & address in REPORT # 1 down TO REPORT #2
6.... Insert YOUR name & address in the REPORT # 1 Position.

PLEASE MAKE SURE you copy every name & address ACCURATELY!

**** Take this entire letter, with the modified list of names, and save it on
your computer. DO NOT MAKE ANY OTHER CHANGES. Save this on a
disk as well just in case if you loose any data. To assist you with marketing
your business on the internet, the 5 reports you purchase will provide you
with invaluable marketing information which includes how to send bulk
e-mails legally, where to find thousands of free classified ads and much
more. There are 2 Primary methods to get this venture going:

METHOD #1: BY SENDING BULK E-MAIL LEGALLY
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

Let's say that you decide to start small, just to see how it goes, and we will
assume You and those involved send out only 5,000e-mails each. Let's
also assume that the mailing receive only a 0.2% response (the response
could be much better but lets just say it is only 0.2%. Also many people
will send out hundreds of thousands e-mails instead of only 5,000 each).
Continuing with this example, you send out only 5,000 e-mails.

With a 0.2% response, that is only 10 orders for report # 1. Those 10
people responded by sending out 5,000 e-mail each for a total of 50,000.
Out of those 50,000 e-mails only 0.2% responded with orders. That equals
100 people responded and ordered Report # 2.
Those 100 people mail out 5,000 e-mails each for a total of 500,000 e-mails.
The 0.2% response to that is 1000 orders for Report #3.
Those 1000 people send out 5,000 e-mails each for a total of 5 million
e-mails sent out. The 0.2% response to that is 10,000 orders for Report #4.
Those 10,000 people send out 5,000 e-mails each for a total of
50,000,000 (50 million) e-mails. The 0.2% response to that is 100,000
orders for Report #5. THAT'S 100,000 ORDERS TIMES
$5 EACH=$500,000.00 (half million). Your total income in this example is:
1..... $50 +2.....$500 + 3.....$5,000 + 4..... $50,000 + 5..... $500,000.......
Grand Total=$555,550.00

NUMBERS DO NOT LIE. GET A PENCIL & PAPER AND FIGURE OUT
THE WORST POSSIBLE RESPONSES AND NO MATTER HOW YOU
CALCULATE IT, YOU WILL STILL MAKE A LOT OF MONEY!
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
REMEMBER FRIEND, THIS IS ASSUMING ONLY 10 PEOPLE
ORDERING OUT OF 5,000 YOU MAILED TO. Dare to think for a moment
what would happen if everyone or half or even one 4th of those people
mailed 100,000e-mails each or more? There are over 150 million people on 
the Internet worldwide and counting. Believe me, many people will do just
that, and more!

METHOD #2: BY PLACING FREE ADS ON THE INTERNET
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
Advertising on the net is very very inexpensive and there are hundreds of
FREE places to advertise. Placing a lot of free ads on the Internet will
easily get a larger response.

We strongly suggest you start with Method #1 and add METHOD #2 as
you go along. For every $5 you receive, all you must do is e-mail them the
Report they ordered. That's it. Always provide same day service on all
orders. This will guarantee that the e-mail they send out with your name
and address on it, will be prompt because they can not advertise until they
receive the report.
=ORDER EACH REPORT BY ITS NUMBER & NAME ONLY. Notes: Always
send $5 cash (U.S. CURRENCY) for each Report. Checks NOT
accepted. Make sure the cash is concealed by wrapping it in at least 2
sheets of paper or aluminum foil. On one of those sheets of paper, Write
the NUMBER & the NAME of the Report you are ordering, YOUR E-MAIL 
ADDRESS and your name and postal address.

""My name is Mitchell. My wife, Jody and I live in Chicago. I am an
accountant with a major U.S. Corporation and I make pretty good money.
When I received this program I grumbled to Jody about receiving 
""junk mail"". I made fun of the whole thing, spouting my knowledge of the
population and percentages involved. I ""knew"" it wouldn't work. Jody
totally ignored my supposed intelligence and few days later she jumped in
with both feet. I made merciless fun of her, and was ready to lay the old 
""I told you so"" on her when the thing didn't work. Well, the laugh was on
me! Within 3 weeks she had received 50 responses. Within the next 45
days she had received total $ 147,200.00....all cash! I was shocked.
I have joined Jody in her ""hobby"".

""Not being the gambling type, it took me several weeks to make up my
mind to participate in this plan. But conservative that I am, I decided that
the initial investment was so little that there was just no way that I
wouldn't get enough orders to at least get my money back"". ""I was
surprised when I found my medium size post office box crammed with
orders. I made $319,210.00 in the first 12 weeks. The nice thing about
this deal is that it does not matter where people live. There simply isn't a
better investment with a faster return and so big"".

""I had received this program before. I deleted it, but later I wondered if I
should have given it a try. Of course, I had no idea who to contact to get
another copy, so I had to wait until I was e-mailed again by someone
else......11 months passed then it luckily came again...... I did not delete
this one! I made more than $490,000 on my first try and all the money
came within 22 weeks"".

I'm trying to set up the following:
1. A Linux server running with a modem for internet connectivity and an
ethernet card for LAN connectivity
2. Other LAN pcs with ethernet cards, using the Linux server for
DNS/DHCP etc.
Basically, I want to route any non LAN traffic through the ppp0.
I've got some of the way, but like a similar post earlier about modem
problems, when I am connected to the internet with eht0 up, the routing
is all incorrect and noting goes out through ppp0 (eh0 must be the
default route or something).
Is there standard ""out of the box"" Linux tools that will carry out
portmapping on behalf of the LAN PCs ?  (I'm planning on non routable
addresses 192.168.x.x for the LAN, routed outwards via the ppp0
interface).
Can someone point me at the right HOWTOs or routing documentation I need
to follow ? 
Thanks,
Dermot.

Nope, that's her. Particularly exciting moments stage managing ""The

his play and our male lead fell off the stage. Ahem. The joys of attending

Hey, Rick, that's quite nice. Not to demean my own accomplishments, but I
don't have a &&^*$%&^% film deal, which pays more per hour than I'll make
in a lifetime of short fiction. OTOH, count my blessings -- I've had
fourteen stories in print this year, already fifteen more coming next
year, strong critical reception and my first collection due out this
coming spring.
Ah. I feel much better now. Take that, Becky Miller!
(But I'll bet she drives a nicer car than me.)

They removed /their/ Java VM. They didn't remove the ability to run Java
programs.
Anybody is free to develop their own Java VM and make it kick ass. As

<font size=3><b>Techs slump with Intel</b></font><br>
With investors selling Intel shares before its post-market close earnings announcement, technology stocks dropped Tuesday.
<p>
Despite generally upbeat remarks on the economy by Fed Chair Alan Greenspan and news of a profitable quarter from Nextel Communications, CNET's Tech index slipped 12.4 points, or 1.25 percent, to 992.91. The tech-laden Nasdaq composite index fell 7.36 points, or 0.53 percent, to 1,375.26.
<p>
Worse-than-expected earnings from construction machinery maker Caterpillar helped depress broader markets. The Dow Jones industrial average lost 166.0 points, or 1.92 percent, to 8,473.1--for its seventh consecutive losing session. The S&P 500 shed 16.99 points, or 1.85 percent, to 900.94--another multi-year low.

Analyst Douglas Lee says the maker of power supply integrated circuits is building a market niche with a more efficient and reliable technology than traditional approaches to converting AC-to-DC power supplies. He also notes Power Integrations is expanding its market with DC-to-DC power supply products, and says the firm's growth is based on converting today's power supplies to its more efficient technologies. As a result, the company doesn't need a boost in end-market demand to grow, Lee says. Although he sees a large, untapped market for Power Integrations and likes its long-term prospects, Lee suggests the stock is fairly valued. He believes shares of POWI are unlikely to rise much in the short term.<br><B>POWER INTEGRATIONS 18.72 5.23% </B><br>

 A French television executive said on Tuesday he had been approached about taking over as finance chief at beleaguered media giant Vivendi Universal -- and acknowledged the job would be a ""challenge.""
Jacques Espinasse, chief operating officer at French satellite TV consortium TPS, has been cited by the French press as a candidate for the financial hot seat at Vivendi, which is grappling with cash and debt problems in the wake of the sacking earlier this month of chairman Jean-Marie Messier.<br><B>VIVENDI UNIVERSAL 15.38 -5.06% </B><br>

It seemed that way to me when I ripped the classifier out of it -- I don't

Someone else will have to answer that (I don't use GBayes or hammie, at

That's been done now, right?

Those tokenizers are truly trivial to rewrite from scratch if they're
interesting.  The tiny spam/ham collections in GBayes are also worthless
now.  The ""self test"" feature didn't do anything except print its results;
Tester.py since became doctest'ed and verifies that some basic machinery
actually delivers what it's supposed to deliver.

Exactly -- ""let's you and him fight"" is a
way of dealing with troublesome populations
by moving them next to one another, so they
give each other, and not the Man, grief*.
So by my understanding (and, you all will
understand, with tongue firmly in cheek):
Ireland:  Irish?  Uppity barbarians overly
   fond of ""risings"".  Scots?  More uppity
   barbarians overly fond of ""risings"".
   Why not plonk down a bunch of the latter
   next to the former and kill two birds
   with one stone?
Israel:  Ex-ottomans?  Uppity barbarians
   (didn't they help kick out the Ottomans?)
   Zionists?  Uppity sorts who aren't happy
   with perfectly good land in Uganda.  Why
   not plonk down a bunch of the latter next
   to the former and kill two birds with one
   stone?
but not:
India: in which the muslims and hindus were
    originally intermixed to some degree,
    but Partioned due to their own conflict,
    not due to English resettlement policy.
Canada: in which the french and english were
    already established, and it was just the
    balance of power on the continent that
    determined events in the colonies.  The
    Acadians got resettled, but they don't
    seem to have been that good for picking
    fights with their neighbors, so no one
    had them plonked down next door.

Sure.  But for most people, changing their company's or ISP's server
requires years of lobbying, while they have total and immediate
control over their own MUA.
That said, I agree that we should offer a good solution to

I actually thought of this kind of active chat at AOL (in 1996 I think),
bringing up ads based on what was being discussed and other features. &nbsp;For
a while, the VP of dev. (now still CTO I think) was really hot on the idea
and they discussed patenting it. &nbsp;Then they lost interest. &nbsp;Probably a good

Gack. Did you try 7.3 with the compat-glibc first? Or does it require an
antique kernel?

The restrictive law regarding audio is actually the accumulated cruft of
30 years of various legislative acts. The totality of what we have now
come from various parts of all the following re: sound recordings:
1998 - DMCA
1995 - Digital Performance Right in Sound Recordings Act
1992 - Audio Home Recording Act
1976 - Copyright Act amendment
1972 - Copyright Act amendment
It is worth noting that many people have forgotten about the 1976
Copyright Act Amendment which created the foundational law stating that
the copyright owners have the right to limit personal use of audio
recordings after First Sale even if you are not ""making copies"" in any
commercial sense.  Sound recordings, for many intents and purposes, are
explicitly excluded from Fair Use by the 1976 amendment.

 Ah, they told me that about my A1200. Just got a video box, cut air holes
and a hole for the cables, then got an extra-long 2.5"" to 3.5"" IDE cable,
and connected it up. Had to make a few holes in the A1200 case for the
IDE cable too.
 Worked a charm. Until I dropped the disk one day onto concrete.

Back when I was running the WSMF shoutcast server these restrictions were
just being placed on netcasters. Most folks laughed it off. Now with the
license fees its not laughable anymore. If you pay the fee you are bound
to the restrictions, if you dont your running the criminal line.
I still run a stream up on live365. Its been playing the same 10 hour
block of Jean Shepard shows for the last year. I really should change them
up.
If I were going to do the old WSMF shoutcast now adays I would either
spend lots of time going over regulations to see what I can or cannot do
or I would just chuck the regs out and do what I want. Or I might write
some apps to stay in regs ..I dont know..one thing is for sure it

You may have seen this business before and
ignored it. I know I did - many times! However,
please take a few moments to read this letter.
I was amazed when the profit potential of this
business finally sunk in... and it works!
With easy-to-use e-mail tools and opt-in e-mail,
success in this business is now fast, easy and
well within the capabilities of ordinary people
who know little about internet marketing. And the
earnings potential is truly staggering!
I'll make you a promise. READ THIS E-MAIL TO THE END! -
follow what it says to the letter - and you will not
worry whether a RECESSION is coming or not, who is
President, or whether you keep your current job or not.
Yes, I know what you are thinking. I never responded
to one of these before either. One day though,
something just said: ""You throw away $25.00 going to
a movie for 2 hours with your wife. What the heck.""
Believe me, no matter where you believe those ""feelings""
come from, I thank every day that I had that feeling. 
I cannot imagine where I would be or what I would be
doing had I not. Read on. It's true. Every word of it.
It is legal. I checked. Simply because you are buying
and selling something of value.
AS SEEN ON NATIONAL TV:
Making over half a million dollars every 4 to 5
months from your home.
THANKS TO THE COMPUTER AGE AND THE INTERNET!
==================================================
BE AN INTERNET MILLIONAIRE LIKE OTHERS WITHIN A YEAR!!!
Before you say ""Bull"", please read the following.
This is the letter you have been hearing about on the
news lately. Due to the popularity of this letter on
the internet, a national weekly news program recently
devoted an entire show to the investigation of this
program described below, to see if it really can make
people money. The show also investigated whether or
not the program was legal.
Their findings proved once and for all that there are
""absolutely NO laws prohibiting the participation in
the program and if people can 'follow the simple
instructions' they are bound to make some mega bucks
with only $25 out of pocket cost"".
DUE TO THE RECENT INCREASE OF POPULARITY & RESPECT
THIS PROGRAM HAS ATTAINED, IT IS CURRENTLY WORKING
BETTER THAN EVER.
This is what one had to say: ""Thanks to this
profitable opportunity. I was approached many times
before but each time I passed on it. I am so glad
I finally joined just to see what one could expect
in return for the minimal effort and money required.
To my astonishment, I received a total $610,470.00
in 21 weeks, with money still coming in.""
Pam Hedland, Fort Lee, New Jersey.
==================================================
Another said: ""This program has been around for a
long time but I never believed in it. But one day
when I received this again in the mail I decided
to gamble my $25 on it. I followed the simple
instructions and walaa ..... 3 weeks later the
money started to come in. First month I only made
$240.00 but the next 2 months after that I made
a total of $290,000.00. So far, in the past 8 months
by re-entering the program, I have made over
$710,000.00 and I am playing it again. The key to
success in this program is to follow the simple
steps and NOT change anything.""

If you would like to make at least $500,000 every
4 to 5 months easily and comfortably, please read the
following...THEN READ IT AGAIN and AGAIN!!!
$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$
FOLLOW THE SIMPLE INSTRUCTION BELOW AND 
YOUR FINANCIAL DREAMS WILL COME TRUE, GUARANTEED!
INSTRUCTIONS:
=====Order all 5 reports shown on the list below =====
For each report, send $5 CASH, THE NAME & NUMBER OF THE
REPORT YOU ARE ORDERING and YOUR E-MAIL ADDRESS to the
person whose name appears ON THAT LIST next to the report.
MAKE SURE YOUR RETURN ADDRESS IS ON  YOUR ENVELOPE TOP
LEFT CORNER in case of any mail problems.
===WHEN YOU PLACE YOUR ORDER, MAKE SURE ===
===YOU ORDER EACH OF THE 5 REPORTS! ===
You will need all 5 reports so that you can save
them on your computer and resell them.
YOUR TOTAL COST $5 X 5 = $25.00.
Within a few days you will receive, via e-mail, each
of the 5 reports from these 5 different individuals.
Save them on your computer so they will be accessible
for you to send to the 1,000's of people who will
order them from you. Also make a floppy of these
reports and keep it on your desk in case something
happens to your computer.
IMPORTANT - DO NOT alter the names of the people who
are listed next to each report, or their sequence on
the list, in any way other than what is instructed
below in steps 1 through 6 or you will lose out
on the majority of your profits. Once you
understand the way this works, you will also
see how it will not work if you change it. 
Remember, this method has been tested, and if you
alter it, it will NOT work!!! People have tried
to put their friends'/relatives' names on all five
thinking they could get all the money. But it does
not work this way. Believe us, some have tried to
be greedy and then nothing happened. So Do Not
try to change anything other than what is instructed.
Because if you do, it will not work for you.
Remember, honesty reaps the reward!!! 
This IS a legitimate BUSINESS. You are offering a
product for sale and getting paid for it. Treat it
as such and you will be VERY profitable in a short
period of time.
1.. After you have ordered all 5 reports, take this
advertisement and REMOVE the name & address of the
person in REPORT # 5. This person has made it through
the cycle and is no doubt counting their fortune.
2.. Move the name & address in REPORT # 4 down TO REPORT # 5.
3.. Move the name & address in REPORT # 3 down TO REPORT # 4.
4.. Move the name & address in REPORT # 2 down TO REPORT # 3.
5.. Move the name & address in REPORT # 1 down TO REPORT # 2
6.... Insert YOUR name & address in the REPORT # 1 Position.
PLEASE MAKE SURE you copy every name & address
ACCURATELY! This is critical to YOUR success.
==================================================
**** Take this entire letter, with the modified
list of names, and save it on your computer.
DO NOT MAKE ANY OTHER CHANGES.
Save this on a disk as well just in case you lose
any data. To assist you with marketing your business
on the internet, the 5 reports you purchase will
provide you with invaluable marketing information
which includes how to send bulk e-mails legally,
where to find thousands of free classified ads and
much more. There are 2 primary methods to get this
venture going:
METHOD # 1: BY SENDING BULK E-MAIL LEGALLY
==================================================
Let's say that you decide to start small, just to see
how it goes, and we will assume you and those involved
send out only 5,000 e-mails each. Let's also assume
that the mailing receives only a 0.2% (2/10 of 1%)
response (the response could be much better but let's
just say it is only 0.2%). Also many people will send
out hundreds of thousands of e-mails instead of only
5,000 each.
Continuing with this example, you send out only
5,000 e-mails. With a 0.2% response, that is only
10 orders for report # 1. Those 10 people responded
by sending out 5,000 e-mails each for a total of
50,000. Out of those 50,000 e-mails only 0.2%
responded with orders. That's 100 people who
responded and ordered Report # 2.
Those 100 people mail out 5,000 e-mails each for
a total of 500,000 e-mails. The 0.2% response to
that is 1000 orders for Report # 3.
Those 1000 people send 5,000 e-mails each for a
total of 5 million e-mails sent out. The 0.2%
response is 10,000 orders for Report # 4.
Those 10,000 people send out 5,000 e-mails each
for a total of 50,000,000 (50 million) e-mails.
The 0.2% response to that is 100,000 orders for
Report # 5.
THAT'S 100,000 ORDERS TIMES $5 EACH = $500,000.00
(half a million dollars).
Your total income in this example is: 1..... $50
+ 2..... $500 + 3.....$5,000 + 4..... $50,000
+ 5.... $500,000 .... Grand Total=$555,550.00
NUMBERS DO NOT LIE. GET A PENCIL & PAPER AND
FIGURE OUT THE WORST POSSIBLE RESPONSES AND NO
MATTER HOW YOU CALCULATE IT, YOU WILL STILL
MAKE A LOT OF MONEY!
==================================================
REMEMBER FRIEND, THIS IS ASSUMING ONLY 10 PEOPLE
ORDERING OUT OF 5,000 YOU MAILED TO. Dare to think
for a moment what would happen if everyone or half
or even one 4th of those people mailed 100,000
e-mails each or more?
There are over 150 million people on the internet
worldwide and counting, with thousands more coming
online every day. Believe me, many people will do
just that, and more!
METHOD # 2: BY PLACING FREE ADS ON THE INTERNET
==================================================
Advertising on the net is very, very inexpensive and
there are hundreds of FREE places to advertise.
Placing a lot of free ads on the internet will
easily get a larger response. We strongly suggest
you start with Method # 1 and add METHOD # 2 as you
go along. For every $5 you receive, all you must
do is e-mail them the report they ordered. That's it.
Always provide same day service on all orders.
This will guarantee that the e-mail they send out,
with your name and address on it, will be prompt
because they cannot advertise until they receive
the report.
===========AVAILABLE REPORTS ====================
The reason for the ""cash"" is not because this is
illegal or somehow ""wrong"". It is simply about time.
Time for checks or credit cards to be cleared or
approved, etc. Concealing it is simply so no one
can SEE there is money in the envelope and steal
it before it gets to you.
ORDER EACH REPORT BY ITS NUMBER & NAME ONLY.
Notes: Always send $5 cash (U.S. CURRENCY) for
each report. Checks NOT accepted. Make sure the
cash is concealed by wrapping it in at least
2 sheets of paper. On one of those sheets of
paper, write the NUMBER & the NAME of the report
you are ordering, YOUR E-MAIL ADDRESS and your
name and postal address.

$$$$$$$$$ YOUR SUCCESS GUIDELINES $$$$$$$$$$$
Follow these guidelines to guarantee your success:
=== If you do not receive at least 10 orders for
Report #1 within 2 weeks, continue sending e-mails
until you do.
=== After you have received 10 orders, 2 to 3 weeks
after that you should receive 100 orders or more for
REPORT # 2. If you do not, continue advertising or
sending e-mails until you do.
** Once you have received 100 or more orders for
Report # 2, YOU CAN RELAX, because the system is
already working for you, and the cash will continue
to roll in ! THIS IS IMPORTANT TO REMEMBER: Every time
your name is moved down on the list, you are placed
in front of a different report.
You can KEEP TRACK of your PROGRESS by watching which
report people are ordering from you. IF YOU WANT TO
GENERATE MORE INCOME SEND ANOTHER BATCH OF E-MAILS
AND START THE WHOLE PROCESS AGAIN. There is NO LIMIT
to the income you can generate from this business !!!
=================================================
FOLLOWING IS A NOTE FROM THE ORIGINATOR OF THIS PROGRAM: 
You have just received information that can give you
financial freedom for the rest of your life, with
NO RISK and JUST A LITTLE BIT OF EFFORT. You can
make more money in the next few weeks and months
than you have ever imagined. Follow the program
EXACTLY AS INSTRUCTED. Do Not change it in any way.
It works exceedingly well as it is now.
Remember to e-mail a copy of this exciting report
after you have put your name and address in
Report #1 and moved others to #2 .....# 5 as
instructed above. One of the people you send this
to may send out 100,000 or more e-mails and your
name will be on every one of them. 
Remember though, the more you send out the more
potential customers you will reach. So my friend,
I have given you the ideas, information, materials
and opportunity to become financially independent.
IT IS UP TO YOU NOW !

Chicago. I am an accountant with a major U.S.
Corporation and I make pretty good money. When I
received this program I grumbled to Jody about
receiving 'junk mail'. I made fun of the whole
thing, spouting my knowledge of the population
and percentages involved. I 'knew' it wouldn't work.
Jody totally ignored my supposed intelligence and
few days later she jumped in with both feet. I made
merciless fun of her, and was ready to lay the old
'I told you so' on her when the thing didn't work. 
Well, the laugh was on me! Within 3 weeks she had
received 50 responses. Within the next 45 days she
had received total $ 147,200.00 ......... all cash!
I was shocked. I have joined Jody in her 'hobby'.""
Mitchell Wolf M.D., Chicago, Illinois
================================================
""Not being the gambling type, it took me several
weeks to make up my mind to participate in this plan.
But conservative as I am, I decided that the initial
investment was so little that there was just no way
that I wouldn't get enough orders to at least get
my money back. I was surprised when I found my
medium size post office box crammed with orders.
I made $319,210.00 in the first 12 weeks. 
The nice thing about this deal is that it does not
matter where people live. There simply isn't a
better investment with a faster return and so big.""
Dan Sondstrom, Alberta, Canada
=================================================
""I had received this program before. I deleted it,
but later I wondered if I should have given it a try.
Of course, I had no idea who to contact to get
another copy, so I had to wait until I was e-mailed
again by someone else......... 11 months passed then
it luckily came again...... I did not delete this one!
I made more than $490,000 on my first try and all the
money came within 22 weeks.""
Susan De Suza, New York, N.Y.
=================================================
""It really is a great opportunity to make relatively
easy money with little cost to you. I followed the
simple instructions carefully and within 10 days the
money started to come in. My first month I made $20,
in the 2nd month I made $560.00 and by the end of the
third month my total cash count was $362,840.00.
Life is beautiful, Thanx to internet.""

me!
Spamd setuid's to the user running spamc. Since you're calling spamc from a
global procmailrc file, it's being run as root (most likely). If called as
root, spamd won't open user_prefs files.
>>From the spamc man page:
       -u username
           This argument has been semi-obsoleted.  To have spamd use
           per-user-config files, run spamc as the user whose config
           files spamd should load.  If you're running spamc as some
           other user though (eg. root, mail, nobody, cyrus, etc.)
           then you can still use this flag.

The solution is to set DROPPRIVS=yes in /etc/procmailrc, just before running
spamc. From the procmailrc man page:
       DROPPRIVS   If set to `yes' procmail will drop all privileges
                   it might have had (suid or sgid).  This  is  only
                   useful  if  you  want  to guarantee that the bottom
                   half of the /etc/procmailrc file is executed on
                   behalf of the recipient.

I hope that helps, and I also hope it's right!

|
|
| Hi All,
|
| I am running SpamAssassin 2.41 with procmail as my local delivery agent
| with sendmail.  I use spamc/spamd so that it runs site-wide from
| /etc/procmailrc.
|
| spamd is run as root with the flags ""-d -a -c"", and spamc isn't run with
| any flags.
|
| When I was testing the program, I deployed spamc from my personal
| ~/.procmailrc file, my ~/.spamassassin/user_prefs file was read each time.
| I can see this because I have a non-default ""required_hits"" value which
| gets reported in every e-mail on the ""X-Spam-Status"" line.
|
| Now that I run spamc from the global /etc/procmailrc file, my
| ~/.spamassassin/user_prefs file is no longer being read or processed from
| e-mails from outside computers.  The ""required_hits"" value gets set back
| to the one in /etc/mail/spamassassin/local.cf.  However, if I send local
| e-mail, my user_prefs file is read and processed correctly.
|
| Does anyone know how to fix this problem?  if this is a spamassassin or
| procmail bug?
|
| Thanks,
|
| Cheryl

It is not uncommon to find gay males who had sex with several thousands
partners (there would be more, in fact lots more, probably, but a lot of
them have died). Don't have to be a callboy, if considering that you can
have intercourse with several partners in a single day in a bathouse it

_________________________________________________
""[M]ost pseudo-scientists have a number of characteristics in
common.
        ""First and most important of these traits is that cranks work
in almost total isolation . . . in the sense of having no fruitful
contacts with fellow researchers. . . . The modern crank insists
that his isolation is not desired on his part.  It is due, he claims,
to the prejudice of established scientific groups against new
ideas. . . .
        ""The modern pseudo-scientist . . . stands entirely outside
the closely integrated channels through which new ideas are
introduced and evaluated.  He works in isolation.  He does not
send his findings to the recognized journals, or if he does, they
are rejected for reasons which in the vast majority of cases
are excellent.  In most cases, the crank is not well enough
informed to write a paper with even a surface resemblance
to a significant study.  As a consequence, he finds himself
excluded the journals and societies, and almost universally
ignored by the competent workers in his field.  In fact, the
reputable scientist does not even know of the crank's
existence unless his work is given widespread publicity through
non-academic channels, or unless the scientist makes a hobby
of collecting crank literature.  The eccentric is forced, therefore,
to tread a lonely way.  He speaks before organizations he
himself has founded, contributes to journals he himself may
edit, and -- until recently -- publishes books only when he
or his followers can raise sufficient funds to have them printed
privately.
        ""A second characteristic of the pseudo scientist, which
greatly strengthens his isolation, is a tendency toward
paranoia. . . .
        ""There are five ways in which the sincere pseudo-
scientist's paranoid tendencies are likely to be exhibited.
        ""(1) He considers himself a genius.
        ""(2) He regards his colleagues, without exception, as
ignorant blockheads.  Everyone is out of step except himself.
Frequently he insults his opponents by accusing them of
stupidity, dishonesty, or other base motives.  If they ignore
him, he takes this to mean his arguments are unanswerable.
If they retaliate in kind, this strengthens his delusion that he
is battling scoundrels. . . .
        ""(3) He believes himself unjustly persecuted and discriminated
against. . . .
        ""(4) He has a strong compulsion to focus his attacks on the
greatest scientists and the best established theories.  When
Newton was the outstanding name in physics, eccentric works
in that science were violently anti Newton.  Today, with
Einstein the father symbol of authority, a crank theory of
physics is likely to attack Einstein in the name of Newton. . . .
        ""(5) He often has a tendency to write in a complex
jargon, in many cases making use of terms and phrases he
himself has coined. . . .""

No. One more problem in some software worked around by using tricks in

The New York Times and Los Angeles Times both lead with word that
a federal judge ruled yesterday that the nation's largest
national gas pipeline company, El Paso, illegally withheld gas
from the market during California's energy squeeze in 2000-01.
The judge concluded that El Paso left 21 percent of its capacity
in the state off-line, thus driving up the price of gas and
helping to induce rolling blackouts. 
and this is the product of overregulation?

Subject: liberal defnitions

Depends on how much over spending vs. how much (and what type) over
regulation.
The biggest problem with over regulation is the costs can be invisible.
It also has the ability to single out particular people, while over
spending spreads the damage more evenly.  Rent control would be an
example of a regulation solution that is in general worse than spending
tons of money on public housing.
As for the definition of a liberal being someone who seeks to impose
both, I find no fault in that definition whatsoever.  The opinion that
EITHER we are spending too much OR we have too much regulation is pretty
much anathema to liberal politics.
Finally, those who argue that there are private replacements for much
government regulation are not saying that a state of nature (no private
replacements, no government regulation) is better than government
regulation itself.
And in my experience people who label themselves 'Green' (which does not
include everyone who loves trees and thinks smokestacks are ugly) is a
watermelon.

Heh. I hit the same problem, but the other way round, when I first
started playing with this - I'd collected spam for a week or two, 
then mixed it up with randomly selected messages from my mail boxes.
course, it instantly picked up on 'received:2001' as a non-ham. 
Curse that too-smart-for-me software. Still, it's probably a good
thing to note in the documentation about the software - when collecting
spam/ham, make _sure_ you try and collect from the same source.

I just wanted to say that I am grateful they choose not to publish my forbidden thought. I sent it in a couple of days before the 9/11 commeration. If I had just watched the sentimental network and cable shows on 9/11 my cynical thoughts would have remain unchanged. However, I watch the Frontline show ""Faith and Doubt at Ground Zero"" on PBS. That show tackled head on, with much more courage than I have seen elsewhere, the larger questions about good and evil, about art as an alternate religion (Karlheinz Stockhausen -- 9/11 was a great work of art), and especially the question about how religion has a darker side which when carried to fanatic extremes tends to negate the humanity of the non-believers.
<P>I am not a religious person but I stunned at the scope of this program. It talked about the Lutheran minister who spoke at Yankees Stadium on a podium with other religious leaders present who was charged with heresy by his own church for promoting the idea that all religions are equal (presumably the Lutherans have the one true path?).
<P>Thanks for listening, I just felt like I needed to put the word out about this program. My shallow comment on Salon and others like it (my boyfriend and I had sex while the towers collapsed) gives me pause about how&nbsp;some&nbsp;of us&nbsp;tend to harden ourselves to the suffering of others.

No...the list has been on target i'd say about 95% of the time.
Iff it starts being a problem, consider it. Right now, John's
right - this remove thread is taking more time than any remove
requests have in the entire past year.
One thing you may want to consider (if feasible) - BugTraq's
adopted a technique by which they add headers to each message
indicating where to email to remove. The catch: the mail is
not sent to ""majordomo"" - it is sent to ""listname-remove""@domain.
I've found that useful when I can't remember exactly which mail
addr I used to signup (since my email addr never shows up in
a received message, and I have multiple addresses going to the
same box).
For all that, remember, even if you put the actual removal
instructions right in the bottom of your email, you will
_still_ get the clueless asking you how to remove. (Trust me,
we've been there.)

byte-code compilation was added, and it is slightly more strict in
its parsing than the original parser.  You can only have a comment where
Tcl would expect to find a command.  Switch has a ""pattern - body""
strucutre, so if you goof and put a comment where it is trying to find
a pattern, both of you will be confused with the results.  The
subtlty arises with extra whitespace and newlines. I can't give you
the exact case, but I know exmh had one example that stopped parsing
correctly, and was arguably wrong before.
2nd - I've managed to remain fairly ignoranat of the PGP support in
exmh, so you'll have to dig in yourself or see if someone else on
exmh-users or exmh-workers is having similar problems.

This make me wonder about the relative protection of smart cards.  They have 
an internal procession unit around 4MHz.  Can we consider them as trusted 
hardware ?  The ability to ship smart cards periodicaly uppon cashing of a 
monthly subscription fee would not raise too much the cost of ""renting"" the 
system.  Smart card do their own self encryption.  Can they be used to 
decrypt data needed by the system ?  The input of the system could me mangled 
and the would keep a reference of how long it was in service.
This sounds really feasible but I may be totaly wrong.  I may also be wrong 
about the safety of a smart card.  
What do you think ?

Most likely in the added overhead of managing more sequences.
I'm sure it can be tuned a bunch, but as I'm leaving for a vacation on Friday, 
and have plenty of ""real work"" to do, I won't be able to do much until I get 
back.
I *will* look at all this when I get back, but if you want to check into 
what's slow and fix things while I'm gone, my feelings won't be hurt.

Hard-drive-based MP3 players, which allow you to store massive 
amounts of MP3s and other files on a portable device, have been

1.2 version of the JSP specifications, and includes 
coverage of the new JSTL Tag libraries--an eagerly

needed in most JSP  applications, as well as thorough 
coverage of Custom Tag Libraries.

""an excellent printed resource on JSPs...I have 
been extremely impressed by its depth, clarity,
 and attention to detail. "" 
--Reuven M. Lerner, Linux Journal
""This is a great book: it was written by a key 
contributor not only to the JSP specification,

 it stands as an important text in the adoption of 
JSP in the market.""

Somehow, it never got mentioned that Lockergnome has a GnomeTome for all 
you 
<a href=""http://www.gnometomes.com/tome/001691.html"">Dreamweaver users</a> out there. Dennis Jarrett, a gnomie from the UK 
with a prolific list of writing accomplishments, lent his brain to a list 
of things everyone should know to make using Dreamweaver 4 (and newer) 
easier to use. I 've never actually used version 4, having stuck with 3 
until recently starting the review process of the StudioMX  suite, but 
I've been  able to apply every tip I tried to some aspect of DreamweaverMX, 
so I can only guess those of you using 4 will want to 
<a href=""http://www.gnometomes.com/tome/001691.html"">check 'em out too</a>.
<p>
As I mentioned in yesterday's Digital Media newsletter, I recently 
switched cell phones to the 
<a href=""http://www.kyocera-wireless.com/kysmart/kysmart_series.htm"">Kyocera QCP6035</a>. 
The unit is Palm powered, with a screen the size of an m105 and all the 
functionality of Palm OS, in addition to having the latest bells and whistles 
you'd want in a phone. Built in Web browsing, by way of MSN, is slightly 
cumbersome compared to what I'm used to from my cable connection, but I can 
already see the usefulness in carrying around portable access to things like 
driving directions. 
<p>
Now that I've got a way to test the final results in real time, I've got a 
more vested interest in making Lockergnome considerably more WAP compatible. 
I'm still figuring out many of the phone's features, so that's still going to 
be at least  a few weeks away. Without a doubt, I'll be sharing my experiences 
in WAPing Lockergnome in an upcoming series of articles.

As a free solution for managing newsletters, for smaller lists, 
this does most of what you need. Subscribers are stored in a 
mySQL database, with the ability to send user confirmation 
e-mails. Initially, the address must still be added manually to 
the database, which isn't idea, but doing this generates a 
confirmation e-mail with a link that users click on if they want 
to be added. The software purges addresses with no response, 
following an administrator defined waiting period. From the php 
interface you can send either text or HTML formatted messages, 
with a built-in preview to make sure your formatting is OK. 
Documentation is somewhat sparse, so prior knowledge of php and 
mySQL are useful in getting this installed.

Think of this as something like ""cron for Windows"" only even more powerful. 
OpalisRobot allows you to schedule almost any process on your server, 
adding an additional layer of functionality, like the ability to program 
telephony commands to complete administrative tasks. OpalisRobot 
effectively processes e-mail commands, in addition to telephone DTMF tones, 
making everything on your server administerable from remote locations, 
even when you can't get remote control access of the machine. Programming 
jobs is point-click simple, saving you time even when you schedule tasks 
to save you time. If you operate in a Windows server environment, you're 
adding extra hours to your day and costing your company additional dollars 
by not having this software.

""If you browse to a Web page that contains an image that has a transparent 
background in Portable Network Graphics (PNG) format, the image background 
may appear to be gray rather than transparent.""
Fortunately, Microsoft explains a solution for this problem. Personally, I 
haven't encountered this PNG display error, but for those of you 
simplementing PNGs on your sites, you'll want to review the solution.

Not only is this information great for improving blog accessibility, it 
happens to be equally relevant for *any* site. The 30 days are nearing 
their end, which means you won't have to wait to find out what's next; 
you can simply click to the next page. Mark Pilgrim, the site's creator, 
sets the stage with 5 characters (all of which could easily represent 
real people) and walks through their physical, mental, and technological 
limitations. Following the character introductions, Mark walks through 
an accessibility scenario each day and then relates the concept back 
specific benefits for each character's limitations. Solutions are 
presented with blogs in mind, but with very little extrapolation you'll 
be able to make every site you design more user friendly.

I've been using Radio from the moment I finally got around to creating 
a blog. The software keeps things simple and automatically updates 
itself when new things get added. Userland goes far beyond creating a 
desktop interface for their blogging system though. They've fully 
documented all the XML, XML-RPC, and SOAP tie-ins used to connect to 
their network, which could easily be adapted to other content 
management applications with some XML knowhow. Backend is the place to 
look ""under the hood"" at Userland's XML inner workings, including 
detailed documentation on making everything work. If you've got 
modifications or improvements to the system, they have an open 
discussion forum for trading ideas.

Dear Investor,
Thank you again for requesting our free special 
report, ""The One Stock that Keeps Wall Street 
BUZZING.""
We began The Motley Fool in 1993 with the idea that 
investors like you deserved better. 
Better than Wall Street's all-too-often biased 
research...  Better than analysts who speak in ""secret 
codes"" allowing them to hedge or spin any 
recommendation...  and better than what passes for ""full 
financial disclosure"" in big business today.
Given a level playing field, we believe that regular 
folks -- like us, and you -- can do quite well in the 
stock market. Why put trust in conflicted information 
from others when you could count on your own 
abilities, and potentially blow the pros away? 
More than two million people visit our Fool.com web 
site each month.  We spend a great deal of time at 
Fool.com instructing people HOW to invest, but not so 
much about WHERE to invest. 
And that's why we created the Motley Fool Stock 
Advisor.
You are cordially invited to join us as a Charter 
Subscriber to Motley Fool Stock Advisor as we focus on 
the great companies of the U.S. stock market. 
In the same, honest, no-holds-barred style that has 
made Fool.com so popular with investors, we'll bring 
you our best stock recommendations and other financial 
insights to help you achieve your financial dreams.
As a Charter Subscriber, you'll get the Motley Fool 
Stock Advisor newsletter delivered to your home each 
month -- a personal communication from us, David & Tom 
Gardner.  We'll tell you exactly why we believe a 
stock is poised for significant growth -- and give you 
all the facts to back that analysis up.  You'll get 
the good, the bad and the ugly on every recommendation 
we make -- so you can make each investing decision 
with great confidence.
Of course, there's more to our Motley Fool Stock 
Advisor than our monthly newsletter.
You'll also receive our monthly, between-issue, e-mail 
Fool Flash to help you take full advantage of breaking 
opportunities.  And you can log on anytime at the 
Motley Fool Stock Advisor subscriber-only Web site, 
featuring current & back newsletter issues...full 
updates on our selected stocks...Q & A...and more.
Best of all, you can try our Motley Fool Stock Advisor 
entirely RISK-FREE.
The Motley Fool community has always been based upon 
trust and value -- principles we intend to continue 
here. So we want to give you plenty of time to decide 
if our Motley Fool Stock Advisor is a valuable 
investing tool for you.
You can try our Motley Fool Stock Advisor for six full 
months 100% RISK-FREE. If we don't prove its worth to 
you, it doesn't cost you a dime.
And you have our word on that.
So join us now. It's going to be fun. It's going to be

Sending mail directly to a backup mail server in the hopes that it has
less stringent spam scanning is a common spammer trick.

Interesting.  I just upgraded to razor-agents 2.14 yesterday, ran

 Hitler-style applicant welcomed by parties
 By Roger Boyes
 
 
 
 MANAGERS of Germanys political parties are having difficulty explaining their
 enthusiastic reaction to a man who applied for membership with letters cribbed
 largely from Mein Kampf, Hitlers personal manifesto. The incident illustrates
 how indiscriminate parties have become in taking on new members during an
 election campaign, even when their sentiments bear a suspicious resemblance to
 those of the Fhrer. 
 
 Edmund Stoiber is a thousand times more suited to leading Germany than the
 present Chancellor, said one letter sent to the Christian Social Union
 headquarters in Ingolstadt. Chancellor Schrder is doing nothing to stop the
 flood of foreigners who are spreading around our Fatherland, said the letter,
 signed by a certain Rudolph Lewald. 
 
 The CSU immediately spotted a potential member. Many thanks for your nice
 thoughts, replied the local party manager, who enclosed an application for
 membership. 
 
 The letter used chunks of Hitlers book, which is still banned in Germany.
 History students have to apply for access to the book in university libraries.
 
 
 The strongest, the brave and the hardworking will receive the birthright of
 existence, only those who are born weaklings could regard this as offensive,
 the letter-writer said. So-called humanity is melting like snow in the March
 sun. Such phrases were lifted from Mein Kampf, which was written while Hitler
 was in jail after the failed Munich putsch of 1923. 
 
 Similar letters, also using the Nazi leaders words, were sent to the other
 political parties and drew sympathetic responses. I read your letter with
 great interest and pleasure, the manager of the Christian Democratic Union in
 Cologne, said. 
 
 Great that you want to join us! enthused the Green Party headquarters. The
 Free Democrats invited the aspiring party member to a fundraising charity ball
 at which Hans- Dietrich Genscher, the former Foreign Minister, would be the
 star guest. The Social Democrats sent a list of rallies to be attended by
 Gerhard Schrder, the Chancellor. 
 
 I wanted to test how serious parties are about combating right-wing
 extremism, said the letter-writer, who was in fact the Cologne novelist
 Rainer Popp. I had no idea that they would be so enthusiastic. 
 
 For the first few days I expected two men in leather coats from the Special
 Branch to knock on my door. Instead only the postman called  with packets of
 election material from zealous political headquarters, Herr Popp said.  
 I was stunned that political parties could react in this way  I reckon I
 would have had the same response if I had signed the letter Adolf Hitler.

As Dan said -- it's a hard corpus, made harder without the spamtrap data.
Also -- and this is an important point -- those measurements can't be
directly compared, because I changed the methodology.  In 2.40 the scores
were evolved on the entire corpus, then evaluated using that corpus; ie.
there was no ""blind"" testing, and the scores could overfit and still
provide good statistics.
In 2.42, they're evaluated ""blind"", on a totally unseen set of messages,
so those figures would be a lot more accurate for real-world use.

Sure - discussion in Forbes - rigorous research, that. Especially when 
the data in their own list
contradicts them. I continue to look at the list and all the ""inherited, 
growed"" entries. I guess if
I read it enough times my vision will clear.

I, at on point, looked into Stanford Business School. After learning 
that tuition was > 20K,
no financial aid was available, and part-time work was disallowed, this 
smart person decided
that I was not willing to spend the $150 application fee 
(non-refundable). During attendance at
my local business school, I was told repeatedly I should have gone for 
it - to quote a prof, (Northwestern MBA), it
has nothing to do with the education you receive - in general European 
(and Canadian) business
schools are better and more innovative - its the connections. He used 
the words ""American nobility.""

Its interesting but in this part of the World (Nova Scotia) a recent 
study found that college graduates
earn less than graduates of 2 year community colleges (trade schools). 
They did decline to mention
that the demand for some trades  is so great that some of
them are demanding university degrees to get in. Just for the record - 
the average salary for
a university graduate (including advanced degree holders) here is C$ 
21,000  -- < $14,000 US. No wonder
half of San Francisco has set up here - we have a whole whack of call 
centers that
have arrived here in the last couple of years - I think they hire some 
entry level IT people for around $10 ($6 US) an
hour, which of course, fits perfectly for me - my entry level job, in 
1986, paid $11.00 an hour. The fundamental difference
is that most of the jobs that require a trade are *unionized*.In other 
words, in this part of the world, for the vast majority of people, 
 union dues are a better investment than tuition. The counter-argument 
to this is that many college graduates
 leave for better work elsewhere, but the counter-counter argument is 
that we are the thin edge
(one of several really - prison labor in the US would be another) of 
third-world wages and work practices coming
 to North America.
I worked at a company that had a 14-year wage freeze. The fact that they 
could maintain that (and prosper) just says
 volumes about the economy in this part of the world. I met many people 
there, like me, who felt that was fine, I can vote
with my feet. They didn't quite realize that just about every large 
employer in the area has similar, or worse, policies. Anyway
eventually they started a union drive. During the vote, retired 
employees were brought in by the employer (rumours were
that they were paid the going rate for a vote around here - a bottle of 
rum) and somehow allowed to vote . The union filed
 a grievance - which was denied - by a Minister of Labour, who, hey, 
guess what - used to be a VP at the company.
That's free labor markets at work. The business continues to prosper - 
as I was told when I was there -  it is a cash cow as long
as the JOA (Joint Operating Agreement) with the competing paper is in 
place.
And if you think that any of those wonderful American companies, out of 
some free-enterprise belief in competing for the best talent,
are going to do anything about that, sorry, most of them received 
generous subsidies, in return, I'm sure, for an understanding about
the labor markets here.

Much as I like to accept what you say - I do believe in free markets , I 
have difficulty finding any - except of course for
labor markets, which governments go to great lengths to protect (well 
unless the supply is tight)
It was a great run with the technology industry - producing most of the 
self-made billionaires on
the list, but now we've got a government-sponsored monopoly, and the 
concept of ""more stuff, cheaper""
which it has always promised - seems to be disappearing. A particularly 
galling example is
high-speed internet access. An article I read a couple of years ago that 
it is an area where the pricing
approaches of the IT industry (cheaper, better or you die) and the 
telecom industry (maintain your
monopoly through regulation, and get guaranteed price increases through 
the same regulators) meet.
Sadly to say, the telecom industry seems to have won. The whole 
entertainment industry/RIAA/Palladium thing
seems to be another instance where actually giving value to the customer 
seems less important than using
regulation to reduce competition and substitute products in order to 
produce profits for the favored few.

I usually agree - but when there's a Republican in office -  I feel like 
they're the biggest believers in
the Manifesto, in reverse. Create a reserve pool of labor, reduce the 
rights of that ""proletariat"" you've
just created with bogus ""law and order"" policies , concentrate capital 
in the hands of a few (ideally people
who can get you reelected) and the economy will take care of itself. Oh, 
and lie - use
the word ""compassionate"" a lot. I guess I tend to believe that a certain 
amount of poverty reduction actually
helps a modern capitalist state - the basic economic tenet of the 
Republic party seems to be the more homeless under
 each overpass, the more efficient the rest of us will be.
And the facts are, for most people in the Western world  are declining 
standards of living, declining benefits, disappearing social safety net,
greater working hours,  essentially since the entrance of women into the 
work force (not blaming women in any way, they have a right
 to work but its now 2 wage-earners in each family and still declining 
standards of living) is the reality.
Again to quote that wonderfully liberal document I keep coming back to - 
the CIA world factbook - on the US economy:
""Since 1975, practically all the gains in household income have gone to 
the top 20% of households""

Bill Mann, TMF Otter</a> (with <a href=""http://www.fool.com/m.asp?i=690013"">Matt Richey, TMF Matt</a>)
<br /><br />
<P>In Lesson 1, we offered a list of red flags that trigger instant sales. These things are pretty easy to spot, if you keep up with current events surrounding the companies you hold.
<BR><BR>Notice that we didn't spend much (meaning any) time discussing Wall Street analyst upgrades or downgrades. This is for one reason: We don't care what analysts think, and we certainly don't put any credence in their deeply compromised ratings systems.</P>
<P></P>
<P>Sure, we read analyst research. After all, many analysts have significantly more access to business management than we ever will as individual investors, so they can have some valuable insights. But if you want to watch a much better predictor of company trouble than analyst rating systems, watch the bond market (more on this later). ""Strong buy?"" Pfffffft.</P>
<P></P>
<P>In this lesson, we look specifically at signs that a company is slipping. Investors need to remember one key point: For highly valued companies, it only takes a small slip to lead to a large share price decline. For example, a company priced at a multiple of 30 times earnings is expected to grow faster than one that is priced at 15 times. As a result, investors in the high-multiple company are much more likely to be traumatized if its business starts to show slowing growth (in earnings, sales, cash flows, whatever). Thus, with highly valued companies in particular, it's important to be vigilant in monitoring any slips. Even a company that's growing nicely may be sending clear sell signals.</P>
<P></P>
<P>So let's look at a few instances where companies have started to go wrong. Our goal here is to learn how to recognize the warning signs of an impending stock collapse before it happens.</P>
<P><STRONG><STRONG></STRONG></STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG>Warning sign 1: Slowing sales growth <BR></STRONG>Through 2000, <STRONG>Nokia</STRONG> (NYSE: NOK) could do no wrong. It was one of the fastest-growing stocks in the '90s and the largest, best capitalized participant in one of the hottest sectors of the market: wireless telecommunications. In 2000, Nokia posted revenue gains well in excess of 50% each quarter. Then, in April 2001, it hit a clunker -- 22% growth, followed by 5% growth the next quarter. For investors in a high-multiple (high P/E) company, this is rough. For most companies, a second quarter in a row of dramatically slowing sales is enough. Get out. For a barnburner like Nokia, one is enough.</P>
<P></P>
<P>Some words of wisdom: Keep companies in one of the hottest sectors on a very short leash. Hot sectors cool off -- they always do. Remember, railroads were once the hot sector, then canals, car companies, radios, and so on. It ends. Be ready. If you're expecting sales to continue roaring full-steam ahead and they don't, it's time to position your finger on the sell trigger. If sales growth slows unexpectedly, be prepared to give a company one quarter to bring up its performance. But unload on the second straight quarter of slowing sales, measured on a year-over-year basis. (Always compare the quarterly growth on a year-over-year basis -- a comparison of sequential quarterly growth is a worthless measure. Seasonal effects can skew sequential growth.)</P>
<P></P>
<P><STRONG>Warning sign 2: Divergent sales and profit growth <BR></STRONG>By April 2001, Nokia had shed some 60% of its peak value. Signs were surely evident in advance, right? Why, yes. Companies growing top lines (sales) should generally be growing bottom lines (earnings) at a similar clip. Even though Nokia's sales were growing through 2000 at 50%-plus per quarter, at the end of the year, net profit growth dropped suddenly from around 70% to 40%.</P>
<P></P>
<P>Profits recovered slightly in the fourth quarter, only to collapse in the first two quarters of 2001. The economics changed quickly, and with a hyper-growth company, the stock reacted just as fast. Even those not deeply versed in the technology and economics of the mobile phone industry could see signs that something was wrong. <EM><EM></EM></EM></P>
<P></P>
<P><STRONG>Warning sign 3: Plummeting cash flows<BR></STRONG>In 1999, <STRONG>Lucent</STRONG> (NYSE: LU) looked beautiful from an earnings perspective, but horrible from a cash flow perspective. We look at two numbers: <A href=""http://www.fool.com/m.asp?i=690014"">operating cash flow</A> and <A href=""http://www.fool.com/m.asp?i=690015"">free cash flow</A>. Free cash flow can be low for growing companies, as they have significant capital investment demands, but low operating cash flow is inexcusable. Lucent's experiences are telling. In 1999, Lucent's full-year earnings came out at a gaudy $4.7 billion, based upon $38 billion in revenue. The company was on top of the world, and it was, at the time, the largest telecommunications equipment company by market cap, at $260 billion.</P>
<P></P>
<P>But as Matt and I <A href=""http://www.fool.com/m.asp?i=690016"">detailed in January 2000</A>, big troubles were afoot, lurking in the company's cash flow statement. On an operating cash flow basis for fiscal 1999, the company <EM>lost</EM> $276 million. That's a far cry from the $4.7 billion in reported net income. And on top of that, Lucent had more than $2.2 billion in capital expenditures. Thus, the difference between Lucent's earnings and its free cash flow (operating cash flow minus capital expenditures) was an amazing $7.3 billion, and not in a good way.</P>
<P></P>
<P>The investor who picked up on this scary dichotomy could have saved herself losses in excess of 98%. (As an aside, since 1999, Lucent has gone on to restate its 1999 cash flow not once, but twice, and in the most recent 10-K, the 1999 operating cash flow is reported as a loss of <EM>$1.8 billion</EM>.)</P>
<P></P>
<P>And get this -- you'll see nearly the exact same thing on Enron's old financial statements. Cooked books or no, they weren't generating much cash. In fact, they were destroying it.</P>
<P></P>
<P><STRONG>Warning sign 4: Watch those bonds</STRONG> <BR>Remember what we said about ignoring analysts? Well, it's because their information can be quite conflicted, and it's almost impossible to tell if any one individual has your best interests in mind. Fortunately, another group can give you the same type of signals: investors who hold a company's bonds.</P>
<P></P>
<P>Bondholders buy a piece of a company's debt and are generally paid interest on this obligation by the company. Watch the current price of a bond, and it will tell you the current odds bondholders are giving to that obligation being paid. I recommend keeping a <A href=""http://www.fool.com/m.asp?i=690017"">log sheet</A> where you write down the price of the bond. <A href=""http://www.fool.com/m.asp?i=690018"">Download it here</A>. If you see a drop, the bondholders are growing pessimistic. You might even see this at the same time analysts are shouting, ""Strong buy!""</P>
<P></P>
<P>I recommend the <A href=""http://www.lnksrv.com/m.asp?i=690019"">Yahoo! Bond Center</A>. You can search on any company and get a list of existing bonds. Find a bond with a maturity between five and 10 years hence. Check the price. A bond priced at 100 is at ""par,"" which means that the bond's face-value interest rate fairly compensates the investor for the risk. Some bonds are priced above 100, meaning the interest yield will be lower than face value. These are considered to be very low risk. But some are priced below face value, even <EM>way</EM> below.</P>
<P></P>
<P>As of this writing, <STRONG>WorldCom</STRONG> (Nasdaq: WCOME) bonds are priced at 18, which means that bondholders assume there's little chance they'll be paid. <STRONG>Tyco</STRONG> (NYSE: TYC), for all of its recent problems and high levels of debt, has 6.75% interest bonds, with 2011 maturity priced at 83. That's a discount to face, but not one that alludes to an imminent default. <STRONG>Qwest</STRONG> (NYSE: Q) sports a price of 85 on its 7.25% 2011 bonds, even closer to par than Tyco. These prices don't indicate healthy companies, but they don't insinuate imminent default or bankruptcy either.</P>
<P></P>
<P><STRONG>Warning sign 5: ""It just doesn't get any better""</STRONG> <BR>For a brief time in 2000, <STRONG>Cisco Systems</STRONG> (Nasdaq: CSCO) was the largest company in the world by market capitalization. This should have been a warning. <A href=""http://www.fool.com/m.asp?i=690020"">As I wrote</A> in May 2000 when the stock was around $57, Cisco's valuation of nearly $400 billion implied that investors expected the company's earnings to reach $34 billion in 2010. Yet no company had <EM>ever</EM> generated earnings higher than $12 billion in a single year.</P>
<P></P>
<P>As it turned out, I almost perfectly called the top for Cisco -- it has shed nearly $300 billion in market cap since that article. Only those that decided it couldn't possibly get any better achieved a sale near the high watermark. Cisco showed no signs of a decline. For the quarter that ended Jan. 29, 2000, Cisco turned in sales of $4.3 billion, as compared to $2.8 billion for the same quarter the year before -- a growth rate of 53%. The following quarter was 58% higher, then 62% higher, then 66% higher.</P>
<P></P>
<P>Only Cisco's stock price rise could beat these numbers. Imagine a $385 billion company with a P/E of 156! The assumptions for future growth were mind-bending, though at the time, in the midst of the data revolution, they seemed plausible. As investors, we must be on the correct side of probabilities. Taking a portion of our Cisco investment off the table, at this point, would've been a smart choice. Remember, Cisco's business was fine in 2000, but the enterprising investor knows that a lot has to be right for the situation to work out.</P>
<P></P>
<P><STRONG>Homework<BR></STRONG>For this lesson, we ask you to do the same thing as we did after Lesson 1. Pick a company -- maybe even the same company you looked at last time -- to continue studying. For your company, do the following:</P>
<P></P>
<UL>
<LI>Track the year-over-year sales growth for each of the past four quarters and three fiscal years. Is growth accelerating, staying about the same, or weakening?
<BR><BR>
<LI>Track the year-over-year net income growth for each of the past four quarters and three fiscal years. Is net income growing slower or faster than sales? Is there a trend to these figures?
<BR><BR>
<LI>Track your company's operating cash flow for each of the past three fiscal years. Is it lower or higher than reported net income for the corresponding year? (We're not having you look at quarterly cash flow because those figures can bounce around due to the timing of payments. Annual cash flow data is much more indicative of real cash flow trends.)
<BR><BR>
<LI>If your company has long-term debt, go the <A href=""http://www.lnksrv.com/m.asp?i=690021"">Yahoo! Bond Center</A> and check the price of your company's bonds. (If you don't know whether your company has any debt, just type your company name into the bond center and see if any debt shows up.)
<BR><BR>
<LI>Finally, examine your company's market cap relative to its current net income over the past year. What's the P/E ratio? Is there reason to believe your company has every rosy scenario already priced into its stock? (In the current bear market, this is much less likely than it was a few years ago, but it's still a question you should consider.) </LI></UL>
<P></P>
<P>To help you out, we've put together the <STRONG>Foolish Stock Information Form</STRONG> to track all of your research and information about your stocks.

<!-- /title -->
<!-- letter -->
<FONT face=""arial, helvetica"" size=-1>
I never thought I&#146;d say it, but I&#146;m changing my tune about subscription music services.<p>
When MusicNet and Pressplay launched their monthly subscription services late last year, I was unimpressed. Their music catalogs were limited, the software was clunky, and the copyright protection features seemed unduly restrictive. I wondered how they could ever compete with the seductive (read: free) charms of file sharing. But last week I decided to try out Listen.com&#146;s <a href=""http://clickthru.online.com/Click?q=ea-fjLyQhV4XV2SrBzAwQ4lAUw-5WnR"" >Rhapsody</a>, a subscription streaming music service that recently managed to secure recordings from all five major labels. And now I&#146;m rethinking my stance.<p>
Rhapsody is not for everyone. If you like to burn your MP3s to CD or download them to a portable player, you&#146;ll want to look elsewhere; Rhapsody allows CD burning only for a small portion of its catalog, and only for an extra charge, and you can&#146;t download MP3s at all. But what Rhapsody does have is music, and lots of it--thousands of albums of all major genres on demand as well as tons of preprogrammed radio stations. I think Listen.com might be onto something with its streaming service. Would you pay 10 bucks a month for a service that has all the music you could ask for, but won't allow you to actually download MP3s?

<b>Here are some representative responses from last week's question on who should take the blame for Web sites not being compatible in every browser:</b>
<p><FONT size=""-1"" color=006633><i>""Web builders should be doing as much as possible to support the broadest possible usage by their target audience""</i></font><p>
A little over half the responses put the onus of compatibility on builders.
<p><FONT size=""-1"" color=006633><i>""There are far less browser makers than there are Web builders and users. So it doesn't make sense for users or Web builders to do that job does it?.""</i></font><p>
After Web builders, browser manufacturers got the most blame, although this response makes the best argument.
<p><FONT size=""-1"" color=006633><i>""The ordinary users are one group most at fault since they tend to stick to only one browser.""</i></font><p>
Few responses said users should take responsibility, as most respondents fall into the Web user category.
<p><FONT size=""-1"" color=006633><i>""As a professional designer, I say proprietary code is downright evil, no matter who it comes from--and no matter what nifty trick it does.""</i></font><p>
Quite a number of Web builders wrote in, with many taking responsibility while noting the difficulty of testing in every browser.
<p><FONT size=""-1"" color=006633><i>""Because Web pages are viewed 90 percent of the time by IE it is understandable that the time spent to make a site compatible with the remaining tiny minority has to be justified.""</i></font><p>
A few responses quoted server logs, making the point that it's not cost efficient to make sites compatible for people who choose a low-market share browser.

Thanks for the script.  It also appears that the standard logrotate tools
included with many systems (or at least RedHat systems) will support
wildcards when rotating files so something like
/home/*/.razor/razor-agent.log can be specified...

These are generated directly from comps.xml of RH8.0 so they contain 
exactly the same packages as you'll get by choosing the various categories 
at install time. I didn't bother including SRPMS for these as they are 
rather uninteresting, if you want you can re-generate the .specs by 
running http://koti.welho.com/pmatilai/comps2task/comps2task.py.
BTW the repository only contains the task-packages, you'll need an 
apt-enabled mirror of RH8.0 in your sources.list to actually do anything 
with it.

CERT Advisory CA-2002-21 Vulnerability in PHP
   Original release date: July 22, 2002
   Last revised: --
   Source: CERT/CC
   A complete revision history can be found at the end of this file.
Systems Affected
     * Systems running PHP versions 4.2.0 or 4.2.1
Overview
   A  vulnerability  has been discovered in PHP. This vulnerability could
   be  used  by  a remote attacker to execute arbitrary code or crash PHP
   and/or the web server.
I. Description
   PHP  is  a  popular  scripting  language  in  widespread use. For more
   information about PHP, see
          http://www.php.net/manual/en/faq.general.php
   The  vulnerability  occurs  in the portion of PHP code responsible for
   handling  file uploads, specifically multipart/form-data. By sending a
   specially  crafted  POST  request  to  the web server, an attacker can
   corrupt  the  internal  data  structures used by PHP. Specifically, an
   intruder  can  cause  an improperly initialized memory structure to be
   freed.  In  most  cases, an intruder can use this flaw to crash PHP or
   the  web  server. Under some circumstances, an intruder may be able to
   take  advantage  of  this  flaw  to  execute  arbitrary  code with the
   privileges of the web server.
   You  may  be  aware that freeing memory at inappropriate times in some
   implementations  of  malloc  and  free  does not usually result in the
   execution  of  arbitrary  code.  However, because PHP utilizes its own
   memory  management  system,  the  implementation of malloc and free is
   irrelevant to this problem.
   Stefan  Esser  of  e-matters  GmbH has indicated that intruders cannot
   execute   code   on   x86   systems.   However,  we  encourage  system
   administrators  to  apply  patches  on  x86  systems  as well to guard
   against denial-of-service attacks and as-yet-unknown attack techniques
   that may permit the execution of code on x86 architectures.
   This  vulnerability  was discovered by e-matters GmbH and is described
   in  detail  in  their  advisory.  The  PHP  Group  has  also issued an
   advisory.  A list of vendors contacted by the CERT/CC and their status
   regarding this vulnerability is available in VU#929115.
   Although   this  vulnerability  only  affects  PHP  4.2.0  and  4.2.1,
   e-matters  GmbH  has  previously  identified  vulnerabilities in older
   versions  of  PHP.  If  you  are  running  older  versions  of PHP, we
   encourage you to review
   http://security.e-matters.de/advisories/012002.html
II. Impact
   A  remote  attacker can execute arbitrary code on a vulnerable system.
   An  attacker  may not be able to execute code on x86 architectures due
   to  the way the stack is structured. However, an attacker can leverage
   this  vulnerability  to  crash PHP and/or the web server running on an
   x86 architecture.
III. Solution
Apply a patch from your vendor
   Appendix A contains information provided by vendors for this advisory.
   As  vendors report new information to the CERT/CC, we will update this
   section  and note the changes in our revision history. If a particular
   vendor  is  not  listed  below,  we  have not received their comments.
   Please contact your vendor directly.
Upgrade to the latest version of PHP
   If  a  patch  is  not  available  from your vendor, upgrade to version
   4.2.2.
Deny POST requests
   Until  patches  or an update can be applied, you may wish to deny POST
   requests.  The  following  workaround  is  taken from the PHP Security
   Advisory:
     If  the  PHP  applications on an affected web server do not rely on
     HTTP POST input from user agents, it is often possible to deny POST
     requests on the web server.
     In  the  Apache  web server, for example, this is possible with the
     following  code  included  in  the  main  configuration  file  or a
     top-level .htaccess file:
     <Limit POST>
        Order deny,allow
        Deny from all
     </Limit>
     Note  that an existing configuration and/or .htaccess file may have
     parameters contradicting the example given above.
Disable vulnerable service
   Until  you  can upgrade or apply patches, you may wish to disable PHP.
   As a best practice, the CERT/CC recommends disabling all services that
   are not explicitly required. Before deciding to disable PHP, carefully
   consider your service requirements.
Appendix A. - Vendor Information
   This  appendix  contains  information  provided  by  vendors  for this
   advisory.  As  vendors  report new information to the CERT/CC, we will
   update this section and note the changes in our revision history. If a
   particular  vendor  is  not  listed  below, we have not received their
   comments.
Apple Computer Inc.
          Mac  OS  X  and  Mac  OS X Server are shipping with PHP version
          4.1.2  which  does  not  contain the vulnerability described in
          this alert.
Caldera
          Caldera  OpenLinux  does  not provide either vulnerable version
          (4.2.0,  4.2.1)  of  PHP  in their products. Therefore, Caldera
          products are not vulnerable to this issue.
Compaq Computer Corporation
          SOURCE:  Compaq Computer Corporation, a wholly-owned subsidiary
          of  Hewlett-Packard  Company  and  Hewlett-Packard  Company  HP
          Services Software Security Response Team
          x-ref: SSRT2300 php post requests
          At  the  time  of  writing  this  document, Compaq is currently
          investigating   the   potential  impact  to  Compaq's  released
          Operating System software products.
          As  further  information  becomes available Compaq will provide
          notice  of  the  availability  of any necessary patches through
          standard  security bulletin announcements and be available from
          your normal HP Services supportchannel.
Cray Inc.
          Cray, Inc. does not supply PHP on any of its systems.
Debian
          Debian GNU/Linux stable aka 3.0 is not vulnerable.
          Debian GNU/Linux testing is not vulnerable.
          Debian GNU/Linux unstable is vulnerable.
          The  problem  effects PHP versions 4.2.0 and 4.2.1. Woody ships
          an  older  version  of  PHP  (4.1.2),  that doesn't contain the
          vulnerable function.
FreeBSD
          FreeBSD  does not include any version of PHP by default, and so
          is  not  vulnerable; however, the FreeBSD Ports Collection does
          contain  the  PHP4  package. Updates to the PHP4 package are in
          progress  and a corrected package will be available in the near
          future.
Guardian Digital
          Guardian  Digital  has not shipped PHP 4.2.x in any versions of
          EnGarde, therefore we are not believed to be vulnerable at this
          time.
Hewlett-Packard Company
          SOURCE:  Hewlett-Packard Company Security Response Team
          At  the  time  of  writing  this  document,  Hewlett Packard is
          currently  investigating  the potential impact to HP's released
          Operating System software products.
          As further information becomes available HP will provide notice
          of  the  availability of any necessary patches through standard
          security  bulletin  announcements  and  be  available from your
          normal HP Services support channel.
IBM
          IBM  is  not vulnerable to the above vulnerabilities in PHP. We
          do  supply the PHP packages for AIX through the AIX Toolbox for
          Linux  Applications.  However,  these packages are at 4.0.6 and
          also incorporate the security patch from 2/27/2002.
Mandrakesoft
          Mandrake Linux does not ship with PHP version 4.2.x and as such
          is  not  vulnerable.  The  Mandrake Linux cooker does currently
          contain  PHP  4.2.1  and  will  be  updated shortly, but cooker
          should  not be used in a production environment and no advisory
          will be issued.
Microsoft Corporation
          Microsoft  products  are not affected by the issues detailed in
          this advisory.
Network Appliance
          No Netapp products are vulnerable to this.
Red Hat Inc.
          None  of  our commercial releases ship with vulnerable versions
          of PHP (4.2.0, 4.2.1).
SuSE Inc.
          SuSE Linux is not vulnerable to this problem, as we do not ship
          PHP 4.2.x.

Alas, that's wrong. Both the drives are faster (10..15 krpm vs. ~7 krpm,
faster seek), and the EIDE protocol is ridiculously dumb (queing;
disconnect).

None of them are production quality. Right now only ext2 and ext3 qualify.  
It will take a good while (a year, or two) before we can trust anything
else.

Have you looked inside a dual-CPU 1U Dell? Three drives are easy to get 
in. Anything else would require a redesign, and would in nontrivial 
thermal engineering issues.

I can't think of a single major vendor who sells 1U systems with hardware
EIDE RAID.

I believe you that stuff can be found, if one is looking for it. However, 
I wouldn't put this into production unless I've had that system hanging in 
the local rack under simulated load for a half a year.",ham

All things considered, I get that effect with Mailman, but the viable

something called SmartList which is a bitch to set up.

That 1 is unneeded and is probably whats upsetting your kernel
we use ""console=ttyS0,9600n8"" but the 9600 is mainly cos we are a cisco

I'm looking for investment properties in the Midwest. The issue I've been having is that not every everyone deals with the properties I'm looking for. You know the houses that you are almost sure will not sell; maybe they're really ugly or need a lot of work or are in a bad neighborhood. But for what ever reason, the houses just don't sell.
I need those houses...
Most of the agents I've dealt with were hesitant because there isn't much of a return for what time and effort you invest. However, the private investors I work with use ""unconventional"" private funding so we both can avoid long drawn out loan approvals. In fact most cases we just pay cash and close in a week. I am pre-qualified with Greentree Funding for up to $900,000 for a purchase money mortgage based on a non-owner occupied loan at 90% LTV.  (And of course you get your full commission.) 
I'm not a licensed real estate agent nor am I affiliated with any real estate firm, which means I can work with you just about any way you want. Please don't be under the impression that we have to pay under market value to be interested. Sometimes I can even pay retail price. The only guarantee I'll make is that I will not waste your time, and in most cases I can tell you over the phone whether I'm interested or not. 
If you are looking to purchace a project home from our inventory or would like information on forming an alliance with  Synteligent Properties, please contact me @ 847.366.4300 or email me @ jeremy@synteligent.com

Why wait until you're dead? I'm sure there's enough carbon in

If you're developing Windows applications in an
ActiveX-compatible environment (which includes most major ones
such as Visual Basic and C++), it's time you started taking
advantage of prefab programming components. An amazing array of
controls are out there, with more arriving at Download.com
every day. This week, we've collected the top programs that
handle transparent GIF files, offer prebuilt ActiveX controls,
and edit hex code to get you up and running.<p>

Also this week, we've got two really useful ActiveX entries:
<a href=""http://clickthru.online.com/Click?q=1a-y6ZkIlXH6wJ46AOd5q0_HZB17WsR"" >FileSystem 1.2</a> and <a href=""http://clickthru.online.com/Click?q=2f-hYaFIqnzAaETrfOP26D_8gaZjMZR"" >AppSecureX 2.9</a>. FileSystem gives you access
to drives, folders, and I/O operations; and AppSecureX adds
serial number and shareware-type functionality to your
applications.<p>

Having problems wrangling the Windows File System? The
   FileSystem ActiveX control offers complete access to common
   file information under Windows through three independent
   interfaces. Everything from drive and folder access to file
   I/O operations is available with only a few lines of code.
   Use this control's interfaces to detect media types and
   media insertion, get complete lists of folders and files at
   unlimited folder depth, find out what attributes are set on
   files, and even load logbook files into collections
   automatically. Rope in your files.<P>
 <B><a href=""http://clickthru.online.com/Click?q=83-U-BXQYJ7lFkYQzCtuoAABMMPZ9FR"" >ApSecureX 2.9</A></B><BR>
Prevent pirates from copying your software with AppSecureX.
   This control provides a registration system that produces a
   valid serial number customized to the user's machine. When
   the user installs your software, a unique ID number is
   generated for that system. To get the serial number, the
   user must provide you with his installation number. The
   data file created by the application is encrypted
   differently for each system, so even if someone were to
   crack the file, they couldn't use the information on
   another machine. AppSecure can also give your software
   shareware functionality such as number of days left, checking
   to see if the system clock is set back, and so on. AppSecureX
   works with any ActiveX-enabled programming language such as
   Microsoft Visual Basic or Microsoft Visual C++. A demo
   application is included. Lock up your software.<P>

<B><a href=""http://clickthru.online.com/Click?q=98-FTaOQ_zabm_zRddCW5CH7esbKR9R"" >AppletFile 2.5</A></B><BR>
AppletFile is a set of Java applets that will enhance your
   Web site's file upload and download capabilities. In
   addition to support for SSL, proxy, and authenticated
   uploading, users can upload and download multiple files
   using predefined paths to automate the process as much as
   possible. A scripting language provides for sophisticated
   customization, and the user interface includes support for
   12 different languages. Transfers are faster because the
   applet uses its own compression (AutoZIP). The AutoSYNC
   feature downloads only updated files, and verification of
   file transfer integrity is made possible with built-in
   support for MD5 message digests. AppletFile is based on
   HTTP protocols and is firewall-friendly. This update adds
   Sun's Java Plug-in support for Netscape 6+ browsers and
   shows removable media drives in the browse dialog. Beam up
   your files.<P>

Write, edit, and debug PHP scripts and HTML pages with this
   tool. PHP Master Editor includes an internal browser for
   viewing, as well as a debugger for local testing. Basic FTP
   capability is also included. Specifically designed for PHP
   programmers, the program recognizes and formats functions,
   variables, and classes within the code, and features
   customizable code templates. Get code-happy.

I run exmh routinely from home (broadband) using an XWindows Client tunneled through ssh under <ahem> WinXP.  It works very well in this fashion.
FWIW, I use Eudora under Winder$ because it's less of a virus magnet.  :)
There's more to the story why I run Winder$, but that's really off-topic and I'm already guilty!

As usual for me, this is an aggregate of 20 runs, each both training and
predicting on 4000 c.l.py ham + ~2750 BruceG spam.
Only 25 ham scores out of 80,000 are above 0.025 now (and, yes, the
""Nigerian scam""-quoting msg is still counted as ham -- I haven't taken
anything out of the ham corpus since remving the ""If AOL were a car"" spam),
the f-p rate wouldn't have changed at all if the spamprob cutoff were
dropped from 0.90 to 0.675, dropping the cutoff to 0.40 would have added
only 2 false positives, and dropping it to 0.15 would have added only
another 2 more!
It's spooky.",ham

						<font size=""-1"">With all the corporate scandals--such as WorldCom and Enron--surrounding us, who can you trust nowadays? Well, for starters, you can trust the CNET Message Boards. The <a href=""http://clickthru.online.com/Click?q=c2-oXxLQUEk7X_ZoirgVnxXFZcIuInR"" >CNET Message Boards</a> are as real as it gets. When it comes down to giving or receiving honest tech advice, there's no better place to be. In the Boards there are no reviews or tests by professionals, just real, true-life experiences and discussions from people like you and me who share one common interest: the love of today's challenging technology. There are no sneaky execs here or scandals to worry about, so if you have a specific problem or question 
in mind, post it! You won't be disappointed.

Despite all the horror stories that you hear of hackers and Trojans intruding on one's personal computer, hear why one of our veteran moderators refuses to use a firewall. This discussion gets a bit heated, but her point was well taken. Take a look and see why she refuses, and if you have a cent or two to throw in, the donation jar is wide open. <a href=""http://clickthru.online.com/Click?q=bf-JtRfQ8ZrsdzL4Gl5w8PF_jEuwteR"" >More Security and Virus Alerts discussions</a></font><p>
			
<font face=""arial, helvetica""><b>The scoop on USB 2.0</b><br>
<font size=""-1"">The chances are that the next time you pick up an external computer peripheral, it will be utilizing USB 2.0 to connect to your computer. So what is USB 2.0? Is it that much faster than USB 1.1? Will your current USB port be compatible with peripherals with the new version? Well if you have similar questions, I gathered up some discussion on this topic in hopes that it will bring a better understanding of what's in store for USB 2.0. Take your pick.

Hi, 
   I am wondering if there are any techniques to make a CD-Key of the like 
unbreakable.  Either by giving it a cancelation date and a periodic renewal

Subject: Re: SF Weekly's Ultimate SF Date lineup :-)
Bob,
    Living aboard a Cessna 172 would be challenging, but I did meet a
couple at an airshow in Point Mugu in 1995 or so that had converted an
old seaplane (it was a bit larger than a PBY, I think) to something of a
floating, flying RV.  They visited a lot of airshows and covered a lot of
miles.  I'm sure maintenance (on a 50+ year old airframe), fuel (for two
large radial engines) insurance and other costs were out of my price
range, but what a hoot!
    On a more realistic note, the flight to Half Moon bay was probably 2
hours of flight time at about  $75/hour in the Cessna.  Not exactly a
cheap date, but that's nothing compared to the money I've spent on her
since.  (And loved every minute of it, Darling!!)

Hmm. Seems like every CD player should include the
capability to rip, encode, and cache the last few CDs 
inserted. 
Playback would then never need to face seek delays... 
after the initial ripping, the only use of the laser 
pickup would be recognizing which CD is inserted --
which might be doable faster than a seek-and-start-at-
first-track operation.
You could also take the CD out while it is ""playing"".
Hmm. If the CD is still in the cache, maybe you don't
even have to insert it. Or choose it from a step-through
UI. Instead, you just wave it at an electronic eye of
some sort... and the player recognizes it from the 
silkscreening. Kids would like that. ""Play this,"" they'd
say, facing the CD at the player, and the player would
start immediately.

I *meant* to say that they were 0.99 clues cancelled out by 0.01
clues.  But that's wrong too!  It looks I haven't grokked this part of
your code yet; this one has way more than 16 clues, and it seems the
classifier basically ended up counting way more 0.99 than 0.01 clues,
and no others made it into the list.  I thought it was looking for
clues with values in between; apparently it found none that weren't
exactly 0.5?
> That sure sets the record for longest list of cancelling extreme clues!
This happened to be the longest one, but there were quite a few

at the clues and the HTML.  It was heavily marked-up HTML, with ads in
the sidebar, but the body text was a serious discussion of ""OO and
soft coding"" with lots of highly technical words as clues (including
Zope and ZEO).

Are there any minable-but-unmined header lines in your corpus left?
Or do we have to start with a different corpus before we can make
progress there?

No, sorry.  These were all of the following structure:
  multipart/mixed
      text/plain        (brief text plus URL(s))
      text/html         (long HTML copied from website)
I guess you get this when you click on ""mail this page"" in some
browsers.

I think it's still corpus size.

Some Friends, Indeed, Do More Harm Than Good
September 10, 2002
By MARY DUENWALD 


 
Friends are supposed to be good for you. In recent years,
scientific research has suggested that people who have
strong friendships experience less stress, they recover
more quickly from heart attacks and they are likely to live
longer than the friendless. They are even less susceptible
to the common cold, studies show. 
But not all friends have such a salutary effect. Some lie,
insult and betray. Some are overly needy. Some give too
much advice. Psychologists and sociologists are now calling
attention to the negative health effects of bad friends. 
""Friendship is often very painful,"" said Dr. Harriet
Lerner, a psychologist and the author of ""The Dance of
Connection."" ""In a close, enduring friendship, jealousy,
envy, anger and the entire range of difficult emotions will
rear their heads. One has to decide whether the best thing
is to consider it a phase in a long friendship or say this
is bad for my health and I'm disbanding it."" 
Another book, ""When Friendship Hurts,"" by Dr. Jan Yager, a
sociologist at the University of Connecticut at Stamford,
advises deliberately leaving bad friends by the wayside.
""There's this myth that friendships should last a
lifetime,"" Dr. Yager said. ""But sometimes it's better that
they end."" 
That social scientists would wait until now to spotlight
the dangers of bad friends is understandable, considering
that they have only recently paid close attention to
friendship at all. Marriage and family relationships -
between siblings or parents and children - have been seen
as more important. 
Of course, troubled friendships are far less likely to lead
to depression or suicide than troubled marriages are. And
children are seldom seriously affected when friendships go
bad. 
As a popular author of relationship advice books, Dr.
Lerner said, ""Never once have I had anyone write and say my
best friend hits me."" 
Dr. Beverley Fehr, a professor of psychology at the
University of Winnipeg, noted that sociological changes,
like a 50 percent divorce rate, have added weight to the
role of friends in emotional and physical health. 
""Now that a marital relationship can't be counted on for
stability the way it was in the past, and because people
are less likely to be living with or near extended family
members, people are shifting their focus to friendships as
a way of building community and finding intimacy,"" said Dr.
Fehr, the author of ""Friendship Processes."" 
Until the past couple of years, the research on friendship
focused on its health benefits. ""Now we're starting to look
at it as a more full relationship,"" said Dr. Suzanna Rose,
a professor of psychology at Florida International
University in Miami. ""Like marriage, friendship also has
negative characteristics."" 
The research is in its infancy. Psychologists have not yet
measured the ill effects of bad friendship, Dr. Fehr said.
So far they have only, through surveys and interviews,
figured out that it is a significant problem. The early
research, Dr. Fehr added, is showing that betrayal by a
friend can be more devastating than experts had thought. 
How can a friend be bad? Most obviously, Dr. Rose said, by
drawing a person into criminal or otherwise ill-advised
pursuit. ""When you think of people who were friends at
Enron,"" she added, ""you can see how friendship can support
antisocial behavior."" 
Betrayal also makes for a bad friendship. ""When friends
split up,"" said Dr. Keith E. Davis, a professor of
psychology at the University of South Carolina, ""it is
often in cases where one has shared personal information or
secrets that the other one wanted to be kept confidential.""

Another form of betrayal, Dr. Yager said, is when a friend
suddenly turns cold, without ever explaining why. ""It's
more than just pulling away,"" she said. ""The silent
treatment is actually malicious."" 
At least as devastating is an affair with the friend's
romantic partner, as recently happened to one of Dr.
Lerner's patients. ""I would not encourage her to hang in
there and work this one out,"" Dr. Lerner said. 
A third type of bad friendship involves someone who insults
the other person, Dr. Yager said. One of the 180 people who
responded to Dr. Yager's most recent survey on friendship
described how, when she was 11, her best friend called her
""a derogatory name."" The woman, now 32, was so devastated
that she feels she has been unable to be fully open with
people ever since, Dr. Yager said. 
Emotional abuse may be less noticeable than verbal abuse,
but it is ""more insidious,"" Dr. Yager said. ""Some people
constantly set up their friends,"" she explained. ""They'll
have a party, not invite the friend, but make sure he or
she finds out."" 
Risk takers, betrayers and abusers are the most extreme
kinds of bad friends, Dr. Yager said, but they are not the
only ones. She identifies 21 different varieties. Occupying
the second tier of badness are the liar, the person who is
overly dependent, the friend who never listens, the person
who meddles too much in a friend's life, the competitor and
the loner, who prefers not to spend time with friends. 
Most common is the promise breaker. ""This includes everyone
from the person who says let's have a cup of coffee but
something always comes up at the last minute to someone who
promises to be there for you when you need them, but then
isn't,"" Dr. Yager said. 
Some friendships go bad, as some romantic relationships do,
when one of the people gradually or suddenly finds reasons
to dislike the other one. 
""With couples, it can take 18 to 24 months for someone to
discover there's something important they don't like about
the other person,"" said Dr. Rose of Florida International.
""One might find, for example, that in subtle ways the other
person is a racist. In friendships, which are less intense,
it may take even more time for one person to meet the
other's dislike criteria."" 
Whether a friendship is worth saving, Dr. Lerner said,
""depends on how large the injury is."" 
""Sometimes the mature thing is to lighten up and let
something go,"" she added. ""It's also an act of maturity
sometimes to accept another person's limitations."" 
Acceptance should come easier among friends than among
spouses, Dr. Lerner said, because people have more than one
friend and do not need a full range of emotional support
from each one. 
But if the friendship has deteriorated to the point where
one friend truly dislikes the other one or finds that the
friendship is causing undue stress, the healthy response is
to pull away, Dr. Yager said, to stop sharing the personal
or intimate details of life, and start being too busy to
get together, ever. 
""It takes two people to start and maintain a friendship,
but only one to end it,"" Dr. Yager said. 
Friendship, because it is voluntary and unregulated, is far
easier to dissolve than marriage. But it is also
comparatively fragile, experts say. Ideally, the loss of a
bad friendship should leave a person with more time and
appreciation for good ones, Dr. Lerner said. 
""It is wise to pay attention to your friendships and have
them in order while you're healthy and your life and work
are going well,"" she said. ""Because when a crisis hits,
when someone you love dies, or you lose your job and your
health insurance, when the universe gives you a crash
course in vulnerability, you will discover how crucial and
life-preserving good friendship is.""

Planning battle tactics; for this reason, the intelligence press
reports, spy satellites have had 1-meter resolution for many years.
Finding an individual vehicle in a city might occasionally be possible
with 1-m images and might occasionally also be worth the money.
For small areas you have legitimate access to, it's probably cheaper
to go there with a digital camera and a GPS and take some snapshots
from ground level.  Aerial photos might be cheaper for large areas,
areas where you're not allowed --- or, perhaps, physically able --- to
go, and cases where you don't have time to send a ground guy around
the whole area.

<font size=3><b>Techs rise, but Dow falls on day of Bush speech</b></font><br>
Technology shares climbed Monday as Pres. Bush gave a speech outlining a plan for long-term growth.
<p>
Tech investors also heard positive comments on Intel by C.S. First Boston, and snapped up shares in the chip, storage and computer server hardware sectors. CNET's Tech index rose 15.22 points, or 1.53 percent, to 1,005.33, and the tech-heavy Nasdaq composite index gained 9.04 points, or 0.65 percent, to 1,382.54.
<p>
Amid news of a weakening dollar and an unexpected rise in business inventories in May, broader markets sank. Recovering some from early-day losses, the Dow Jones industrials finished by giving up 45.4 points, or 0.52 percent, to 8,639.1, and the S&P 500 slid 3.47 points, or 0.38 percent, to 917.92.

Analyst Tim Mahon predicts the chip titan will report second-quarter results in-line with expectations, but offer better-than-expected guidance for the third quarter. Intel rival AMD's poor quarterly results stemmed more from company-specific issues than PC market troubles, Mahon says. And he points to other evidence of PC strength, such as Dell's positive comments about the current quarter. Mahon also expects Intel to speak confidently about its new 845G chipset, which he suggests could pressure the shares of graphics chip firms.

I'm afraid rebal is quadratic-time in the # of msgs it shuffles around --
since it was only intended to move a few files around, it's dead simple.
An easy thing is to start the same way:  move all the files into a single
directory.  Then do random.shuffle() on an os.listdir() of that directory.
Then it's trivial to split the result into N slices, and move the files into
N other directories accordingly.

STEVE MBEKI MULETE from Zimbabwe. I am sorry this mail
Will surprise you, though we do not know, my mother Mrs. Clara 
Got your contact through her private search.
Due to the current war against white farmers in
Zimbabwe and the support of President Robert Mugabe to
Claim all white owned farms in our country to gain
Favor for re-election.
All white farmers were asked to
Surrender their farms to the government for
Re-distribution and infact to his political party
Members and my father though black was the treasury
of the farmers association and a strong member of an
Opposition party that did not support the president
Idea. He then ordered his party members and the police
Under his pay row to invade my father's farm and burn
Down everything in the farm. They killed my
Father and took away a lot of items from his farm.
After the death of my father, our local pastor and a
Close friend of my father handed us over will
Documents with instructions from my father that we
Should leave Zimbabwe incase anything happen to him. The will 
Documents has a certificate of deposit, confirming a deposit
Kept in custody for us in a security company unknown
To the company that the content is money hence it was deposited as 
Personal belongings and ensure that we do not remain here as we could
Easily be found by his enemies. The total amount is
US$21.5M.We are therefore soliciting for
Your assistance to help us move the fund out of
Zimbabwe, as our fate and future is far from
reality, hence this mail to you. The president's present ban of
International Press into Zimbabwe and the drop from office of the 
Finance Minister to avoid giving white farmers fund Transfer
Clearance above US$1M is just a few of the
Unthinkable things he is committing in my Country.
I have tried to reach my father's close friend Mr.
John Casahans from Australia also a farmer who was
Leaving in Zimbabwe with us but left with his family
Late last year following this ugly development to no
Avail.
Should you be interested to help us, contact me
Immediately via email for easy communication and I
Will furnish you with the time frame and modalities of
the transaction. We have concluded a wonderful plan of 
Caring out the transfer within two weeks. Please note that 
This transaction is100% confidential and risk free and will 
Not endanger you or us in any way. We have resolved to give you 20%
Of the total sum upon confirmation of the fund in any

Perl doesn't complain that it can't find PerMsgStatus.pm but the function 
check_for_content_type_just_html(). Do you probably have some old rules 
files still lurking around? This test existed in 2.31 but is gone/was 
renamed with 2.40.

tim.one@comcast.net,,,,,,,no-unsubscribe,[Spambayes] testing results,<LNBBLJKPBEHFEDALKOLCCEPKBCAB.tim.one@comcast.net>,"Neil trained a classifier using 3 sets with about 500 ham and spam in each.
We're missing half his test run results due to a cmp.py bug (since fixed);
the ""before custom fiddling"" figures on the 3 reported runs were:
    false positive percentages
        0.187
        0.749
        0.780

        2.072
        2.448
        0.574
    total unique fn 43
The ""total unique"" figures counts all 6 runs; it's just the individual-run
fp and fn percentages we're missing for 3 runs.
Jeremy reported these ""before custom fiddling"" figures on 4 sets with about
600 ham and spam in each:
    false positive percentages
        0.000

        9.874
    total unique fn 970
So things are clearly working much better for Neil.  Both reported
significant improvements in both f-n and f-p rates by folding in more header
lines.  Neal added Received analysis to the base tokenizer's header
analysis, and Jeremy skipped the base tokenizer's header analysis completely
but added base-subject-line-like but case-folded tokenization for almost all
header lines (excepting only Received, Data, X-From_, and, I *suspect*, all
those starting with 'x-vm').
When I try 5 random pairs of 500-ham + 500-spam subsets in my test data, I
see:

This is much closer to what Neil saw, but still looks better.  Another run
on a disjoint 5 random pairs looked much the same; total unique fp rose to
12 and fn fell to 27; on a third run with another set of disjoint 5 random
pairs, likewise, with fp 12 and fn 40.  So I'm pretty confident that it's
not going to matter which random subsets of 500 I take from my data.
It's hard to conclude anything given Jeremy's much worse results.  If they
were in line with Neil's results, I'd suspect that I've over-tuned the
algorithm to statistical quirks in my corpora.",ham

John Waylan (who was interviewed in Wired a few years back) pulled out a 
14.4 second run in the quarter mile (91mph), on a battery pack that 
hasn't been broken in yet. He expects to break his record next year 
topping his 13.1sec/99mph run a couple of years ago. He's shooting for a 
12 second run.
John also took out a replica 1908 Oldsmobile for a respectable 47mph 
run. (Remember, we started out with electric cars.)
Near the end of the day, Kilacycle took the track with an amazing 111mph 
run. Talk about a crotch rocket.

Well, you might be successful too if Arthur Miller had been your father.  Or
is this some other movie?

Sigh.
This sprung out of a report linked by Cindy about the promiscuity of
female monkeys with males other than the alpha male, i.e, specifically
not the tail end of the distribution.  ""By mating with as many
extra-group males as possible, female langurs ensure [etc.]""

This has never happened.  Its relevance is nil.

So I chose not to type ""on average"" explicitly in my post, since this
is FoRK and one tends to assume that people have a clue.

There is no disagreement between us, except that I am more interested
in typical behaviour and you in extreme.  Actually, you probably just
had a bad day and felt like jumping down my throat for the hell of it.

EOT, AFAIC.

Here's a fix that I think will make a real difference.
Ftoc_ShowSequences needs to be able to be called with an optional list of msgids 
to update and if it's called that way it only removes or adds tags for those 
messages.  Then in places like MsgChange, we only update the messages which have
changed.
Also, a separate Ftoc_ShowSequence function which only updates the display of 
one sequence should be written which also takes an optional list of msgids.  
In a place like MsgChange, it would only need to update the cur sequence.
If nobody else gets to it, I'll do this when I get back.
Chris

A Mother had 3 virgin daughters. They were all getting married within a 
short time period. Because Mom was a bit worried about how their sex 
life would get started, she made them all promise to send a postcard 
from the honeymoon with a few words on how marital sex felt. 
The first girl sent a card from Hawaii two days after the wedding.  The 
card said nothing but ""Maxwell House"".  Mom was puzzled at first, but 
then went to the kitchen and got out the Nescafe jar. It said: ""Good till 
the last drop."" Mom blushed, but was pleased for her daughter. 
The second girl sent the card from Vermont a week after the wedding, 
and the card read: ""Benson & Hedges"".  Mom now knew to go straight to 
her husband's cigarettes, and she read from the Benson & Hedges pack: 
""Extra Long, King Size"".  She was again slightly embarrassed but still 
happy for her daughter. 
The third girl left for her honeymoon in the Caribbean.  Mom waited for 
a week, nothing. Another week went by and still nothing.  Then after a 
whole month, a card finally arrived.  Written on it with shaky 
handwriting were the words: ""British Airways"".  Mom took out her latest 
Harper's Bazaar magazine, flipped through the pages fearing the worst, 
and finally found the ad for the airline.  The ad said: ""Three times a 
day, seven days a week, both ways."" 
Mom fainted.",ham

So some guy failed to reach the source, but instead got spin doctor to
deny it.  Wot, is he thick enough to expect official confirmation
that, yes, Blair is going around casting aspersions on Bush???
It's an amusing anecdote, I don't know if it's true or not, but certainly
nothing here supports the authoritative sounding conclusion ""Status: False"".

<font size=""+1""><b>IT sees new profits in Old Glory</b></a></font><br>


Can CRM be tweaked to track terrorists? As the fight against <b>terrorism</b> heats up, the government turns to the tech industry to come up with tools to secure the country against attack. It's an opportunity for patriotism--and for profits. (Nearly $38 billion is slated for homeland security.) <b>Software companies</b>  are sending tens of thousands of proposals to government agencies, some of which are so new they don't have the budget to hire people to evaluate them all.

<font size=""+1""><b>Are Spam blocklists going too far?</b></a></font><br>
Many businesses are turning to spam-filtering tools to regain
control of their e-mail boxes. But legitimate e-mails are being 
deleted, too, now that <b>sometimes-indiscriminate blacklists</b> have
become a key weapon in the war against unsolicited bulk e-mail.
 Companies
subscribe to the lists, bouncing any traffic directed to their
servers that originates from those addresses. Is <b>overkill</b> the
answer to stopping spam? What is your company doing to stop
junk e-mail?

Sun's midframe and high-end servers will see only evolutionary
change through 2006--faster processors, support for PCI-X I/O, 
and InfiniBand, according to <b>Gartner</b>. More significant
developments will come through software, with moves toward
providing public utility-style availability and capacity. But Gartner
adds note of caution concerning <b>Sun's credibility</b>.

					<P>Creditors and shareholders of U.S. Airways found themselves in the upright and locked position Sunday as the nation's sixth-largest airline filed for bankruptcy protection.</P><P>
The Arlington, Va.-based carrier sought cover under the bankruptcy code's Chapter 11, but much of its trouble could be traced to Sept. 11. Remember when all U.S. airports reopened except for Reagan Washington, which was too close to the White House and other gov sites? Remember how it was weeks before the first lonely flights lifted at last? Guess which airline was the major carrier there. (Hint: It's the same one that bled $2 billion in the past year.)</P><P>
Even before the terror attacks, U.S. Airways was an animal in pain. To all the usual industry troubles, add these: fierce competition from discounters, a too-small area of service concentrated on the East Coast, and an unofficial battle with United Airlines for the highest labor costs in the business. Frustrated, the carrier tried to throw in the towel two years ago, reminded the Washington Post. In a bid to get bought by United, U.S. Airways pleaded to federal antitrust regulators that it was
too small to survive on <br>
its own. The feds disagreed and blocked the deal.</P><P>
Now, of course, U.S. Airways has a new flight plan. Among those likely to get airsick: shareholders, whose investment has vanished; employees, many of whom are expected to lose their jobs, even though their unions have conceded hundreds of millions of dollars in pay; and creditors, especially plane-leasing companies, which will collect only as much as a bankruptcy judge approves. (Where, by the way, is the reporter who will pick up the story of these leasing companies? Not one creditor was
named in any account we could find. Yet before we soak our hankies over U.S. Airways, we'd like to hear a word from the folks getting stiffed.)</P><P>
Need a silver lining? Check out the Wall Street Journal, which observes that Continental Airlines ""soared to profitability"" thanks to its time in rehab a decade ago. We're guessing that anecdote is on the minds of Texas Pacific Group, which is plunking down $200 million for two-fifths of U.S. Airways. Texas Pacific also played friend in need to Continental -- and pocketed 11 times its investment.</P><P>
Meanwhile, it will be ""business as usual"" for U.S. Airways customers, the company's chief assured a skeptical New York Times. The airline will even continue to track and to honor frequent-flier miles. Better still: Cautious customers can use U.S. Airways miles to book flights with its marketing partner, United. And, hey, according to an analyst quoted in the Journal, there's at least a 20% chance that United won't be the next major carrier to announce it's gone broke. - Lori Patel</P><P>

					<P>Follow-up has never been the media's strong suit. Once stories fade from page one, so does reporters' interest. And in this summer of corporate scandals, remembering back to Global Crossing's January implosion and bankruptcy is akin to trying to recall the fuss over chads.</P><P>
The Financial Times pegged the company's bankruptcy sale Friday a ""long-awaited"" transaction, but few other outlets seemed to be holding their breath. The dearth of coverage is too bad, because the shock value of the numbers alone is worth attention, especially with Enron and WorldCom following behind it in the Chapter 11 aisle. Bankruptcy, it seems, means never having to say you're sorry. Global Crossing owed $12 billion when it filed for bankruptcy in January. Its sale price? $250 million --
and that's for only a nearly two-thirds stake. Sound too low? Back in January, Global Crossing could have gotten much more, three times that much, and from the very same investment team, Asian conglomerates Hutchison Whampoa and Singapore Technologies Telemedia. But Global Crossing sniffed it was worth way more. </P><P>
Now that it has discovered it's worth way less, here's how the deal carves up what's left of Global Crossing's pie, pending the regulatory approval that's expected in about six months. The two investors get a 61.5% stake; bank creditors get 6%, and bondholders get about a one-third share. Who's missing from the slice-and-dice? Shareholders, of course, who get nothing. The company is unapologetic, and creditors feel lucky for the crumbs. ""The reality is we could have done considerably worse,""
the Wall Street Journal quoted Edward Weisenfelder, a lawyer for the creditors. As for the shrewd buyers, the Financial Times quoted Hutchison's official statement that the deal would extend its telecom capabilities, particularly in its broadband service. But the Wall Street Journal speculated that the company is simply buying low so it can sell higher. </P><P>
Global Crossing's turned-down offer of $750 million is approximately the same amount the company's founder, Gary Winnick, reaped in personal riches from the sale of his stock, as the Journal noted in its page-one story on the telecom bandits. That's a lot of paper bits on any floor. - Deborah Asbrand</P><P>

many places (not just exmh) so some part of me certainly thinks it
is effective.  However, it occurred to me that if we do checkpoint
state, then aren't we modifying the sequences file for the current
folder on every message read?  Perhaps we look at the sequences file
more than once per message view?  Just idle speculation - we can
stick in some time calls to find out how expensive things are.
Someone asked about increasing the time resolution in the exmh log.
We could make that conditional on some support available in 8.3 -
Tcl has had ""clock seconds"" (like gettimeofday) and ""clock clicks""
(high resolution timer) for some time.  But in 8.3 we've calibrated
clock clicks values to microseconds.  It is still only useful for
relative times, but each call to Exmh_Log could emit the microsecond
delta since the last log record.  Of course, we are measuring all
the overhead of taking the log record, etc.  I'll try it out.

But you knew that.
When a Palestinian sets out, to great rejoicing, to attempt to target
children with a homicide-bomb, they are careful to dip the shrapnel in
rat poison.  It helps prevent blood clotting in the victims, you see.
I'm sure all those Jewish homicide-bombers do the same.  Oh wait, there
aren't any.
If the Palestinians are driven completely out, either by expulsion or
death, they will have nobody to blame but themselves.  That won't stop

figure out how to merge your changes and the checked in changes. The lines
between the <<<<<< and the ===== are in your file and the ones in the next

words without butchering the way they look?&#8221; Several people protested 
last week by changing their weblog templates to something like this[2]. Jason 
Levine has more links[3] to those involved. I spoke with one of the people who 
implemented it, and she claims it wasn't a protest as such, more of an inside 
joke. Point taken: the entire point of an aggregator (and syndication in 
general) is to make everyone's words look the same. Counterpoint: the default 
in most weblog systems is to only publish excerpts in RSS feeds; nobody's 
forcing you to publish full posts. This would probably be a good place to 
insert a Zen quote about attachment, but my mind is too fuzzy to find it. 
_Timothy Appnel_: More FFKAR, RDF, and FOAF[4]. FFKAR is &#8220;the format 
formerly known as RSS&#8221;. Sam has already implemented it[5]. 
_Nicholas Avenell_: ESF[6]. &#8220;Are you also fed up with the continuing war 
between RSS 0.9* and 1.0 and 2.0 and whatever else they invent today? Me too. 
So today I invented the Epistula Syndication Format. ESF. It isn't XML. It 
isn't RDF. It's just data.&#8221; Sam[7] would love it, then. But Movable Type 
doesn't support outputting dates in Unix timestamp format[8], which could be an 
impediment to mainstream acceptance. 
_Shelley Powers_: Consumer Rights and RSS[9]. &#8220;I'm not buying into RSS 
0.9x. I'm not buying into RSS 2.0. I'm not buying into RSS 1.0. I changed my 
RSS 0.91 and RSS 1.0 templates to read the following:&#8221; 
    *RSS not supported here* 
    This weblog does not support RSS 0.9x, RSS 2.0, or RSS 1.0. If you wish to 
    view entries, may I suggest that you visit the weblog, and save your fast

Dear Garrison,
There are at least six plans about what to do with
""Ground Zero"" in New York. I believe a suitable memorial
surrounded by a lovely park with benches, walkways,
children's playgrounds, possibly some concessions such
as a restaurant, small theater and a place for art works
would be the best tribute to those who lost their lives.
What do you think should done with the space?
Joe Adams
Hillsdale, New Jersey
I dread the thought of a big memorial in Manhattan
that's designed by committee and that's gone through
public hearings and so forth ----- it's going to be cold
and ugly and pretentious and the upshot will be one more
public space that the public hates, of which there are
plenty already. New York is a bustling commercial city
and that's the beauty of it, it's a city of young
ambitious dreamy people, like the folks who died in the
towers, and it's not a memorializing city. Historic
events occurred in New York that in any other city would
be commemorated with interpretive centers and guides and
historical museums and in New York there's barely a
little plaque. That's a great thing, in my estimation.
It's a hustling city, full of immigrants looking for
their big chance, and compared to that spirit of
entrepreneurship, a memorial plaza with a fountain and a
statue of something seems dead to me. Look at Grant's
Tomb. Who walks past it and thinks about President
Grant? Nobody. People sit in the plaza by Grant's Tomb
and think about lunch, about sex, about money, about all
the things that New York is about. If you want to find
Grant, read his memoirs. His monument seems odd in New
York: it belongs in Washington, which is our memorial
city. New York is for the young and lively.",ham

I may be dense, but why would anyone want to utilize Habeus?  To me, it looks 
like a potential backdoor to anyone's defenses against spam.
If I were a spammer, I'd simply set up a server, send out my spam with the Habeus headers and continue till I was reasonably certain I'd been reported.  
Then I'd simply reconfigure the server and reconnect to a different IP.  As 
long as no one can establish my connection to the web sites my spam is 
directing people to, I'm home free.
Since I can set up spamassassin to I don't ""lose"" any email, what do I gain 
by making it easier for spam to get through??

and evaluated several other window managers. Having lost my 10 years
of customization with my X10 and then X11 desktop at one point
at UCI, I promised myself that I'd never get attached to
another WM.  I limped along in the default Gnome desktop, I
had a few unsuccessful stabs at the Solaris open view 
desktop, but nothing really stuck.   Because of this along
with SGI's love of pre-configured, pre-compiled freeware[1],
I never really made the jump from Irix to Linux either.  
After installing the enlightenment WM, I have to say, I am
really enlightened.  It's definitely a far cry from the no frills
first look from previous versions.  It's only on version 0.17,[2]
but it's a careful balance between simplicity, performance,
(fun) features, applications, and ease of customization.  The
number of themes they have on freshmeat is amazing. [3] After
less than an hour or two of ""nesting"" I already have almost
all my menus and controls setup just the way I want. 
I definitely recommend this to any Irix desktop holdouts.  It's
a great way to refresh your machine SGI without having to bite the
bullet and rebuild it as a Linux machine.

<font size=3><b>Tech stocks drop again on Qwest criminal probe news</b></font><br>
Word telecom Qwest Communications International is being investigated by the U.S. Attorney's office in Denver helped send technology shares lower Wednesday.
<p>
Despite a Merrill Lynch upgrade of Cisco Systems and the fact that J.P. Morgan began coverage on AOL Time Warner with a ""buy"" rating, CNET's Tech index fell 26.23 points, or 2.66 percent, to 965.29. The tech-heavy Nasdaq composite index lost 35.11 points, or 2.54 percent, to 1,346.01--a multi-year low.
<p>
Broader markets also shed value, dragged down in part by a troubled pharmaceutical sector. The Dow Jones industrial average dropped 282.5 points, or 3.11 percent, to 8,813.5, and the S&P 500 slid 32.36 points, or 3.52 percent, to 920.47--also a multi-year low.

Analyst Joel Wagonfeld argues the computer giant is not immune to the persistent, widespread weakness in IT spending. But a roughly 6 percent dip in revenues during the second quarter will be offset by the elimination of losses from the discontinued hard disk drive business, Wagonfeld predicts. In IBM's second-quarter results, he expects continued weakness in hardware but relative strength in software and outsourcing. The company's decision to exit or restructure unprofitable, commodity businesses is sound, Wagonfeld says. He reiterates a ""buy"" rating on IBM.<br><B>INTL BUSINESS MACHINES 68.76 -1.31% </B><br>

I am now preparing a small patch to configure.in for NetBSD (possibly
also useful for Open- and FreeBSD, don't know). Should be ready and
tested in the next half hour.
If you think 2.40 is ready, I would suggest to wait just 24 hours more
for possible reports by b2_4_0 users. Not everyone can follow the
development during daytime (at work).

 concerned about some particular bit of email policy for python.org]
OK, after much fiddling with and tweaking of /etc/exim/exim4.conf and
/etc/exim/local_scan.py on mail.python.org, I am fairly confident that
I can start harvesting all incoming email at a moment's notice.  For the
record, here's how it all works:
  * exim4.conf works almost exactly the same as before if the file
    /etc/exim/harvest does not exist.  That is, any ""junk mail
    condition"" that can be detected by Exim ACLs (access control lists)
    is handled entirely in exim4.conf: the message is rejected before it
    ever gets to local_scan.py.  This covers such diverse cases as
    ""message from known spammer"" (reject after every RCPT TO command),
    ""no message-id header"", and ""8-bit chars in subject"" (both rejected
    after the message headers/body are read).
    The main things I have changed in the absence of /etc/exim/harvest
    are:
      - don't check for 8-bit chars in ""From"" header -- the vast
        majority of hits for this test were bounces from some
        Asian ISP; the remaining hits should be handled by SpamAssassin
      - do header sender verification (ie. ensure that there's a
        verifiable email address in at least one of ""From"", ""Reply-to"",
        and ""Sender"") as late as possible, because it requires DNS
        lookups which can be slow (and can also make messages that
        should have been rejected merely be deferred, if those DNS
        lookups timeout)
  * if /etc/exim/harvest exists, then the behaviour of all of those
    ACLs in exim4.conf suddenly changes: instead of rejecting recipients
    or messages, they add an X-reject header to the message.  This
    header is purely for internal use; it records the name of the folder
    to which the rejected message should be saved, and also gives the
    SMTP error message which should ultimately be used to reject
    the message.
    Thus, those messages will now be seen by local_scan.py, which now
    looks for the X-reject header.  If found, it uses the folder name
    specified there to save the message, and then rejects it with the
    SMTP error message also given in X-reject.  (Currently X-reject is
    retained in saved messages.)
    If a message was not tagged with X-reject, then local_scan.py
    runs the usual virus and spam checks.  (Namely, my homebrew
    scan for attachments with filenames that look like Windows
    executables, and a run through SpamAssassin.)  The logic is
    basically this:
      if virus:
          folder = ""virus""
      else:
          run through SpamAssassin
          if score >= 10.0:
              folder = ""rejected-spam""
          elif score >= 5.0:
              folder = ""caught-spam""
    Finally, local_scan.py writes the message to the designated folder.
    By far the biggest folder will be ""accepted"" -- the server handles
    2000-5000 incoming messages per day, of which maybe 100-500 are junk
    mail.  (Oops, just realized I haven't written the code that actually
    saves the message -- d'ohh!  Also haven't written anything to
    discriminate personal email, which I must do.  Sigh.)
  * finally, the big catch: waiting until after you've read the message
    headers and body to actually reject the message is problematic,
    because certain broken MTAs (including those used by some spammers)
    don't consider a 5xx after DATA as a permanent error, but keep
    retrying.  D'ohh.  This is a minor annoyance currently, where a fair
    amount of stuff is rejected at RCPT TO time.  But in harvest mode,
    *everything* (with the exception of people probing for open relays)
    will be rejected at DATA time.  So I have cooked up something called
    the ASBL, or automated sender blacklist.  This is just a Berkeley DB
    file that maps (sender_ip, sender_address) to an expiry time.  When
    local_scan() rejects a message from (sender_ip, sender_address) --
    for whatever reason, including finding an X-reject header added by
    an ACL in exim4.conf -- it adds a record to the ASBL, with an expiry
    time 3 hours in the future.  Meanwhile, there's an ACL in exim4.conf
    that checks for records in the ASBL; if there's a record for the
    current (sender_ip, sender_address) that hasn't expired yet, we
    reject all recipients without ever looking at the message headers or
    body.
    The downside of this from the point-of-view of corpus collection is
    that if some jerk is busily spamming *@python.org, one SMTP
    connection per address, we will most likely only get one copy.  This
    is a win if you're just thinking about reducing server load and
    bandwidth, but I'm not sure if it's helpful for training spam
    detectors.  Tim?
Happy harvesting --
        Greg

Dalal Mughrabi was a Palestinian woman who participated in a 1978 bus
hijacking in which 36 Israelis and an American nature photographer, Gail
Ruban, were killed. Mughrabi has a Palestinian high school named after
her, and it's apparently starting to show signs of wear. Fortunately,
the United States Agency for International Development has stepped in
with money to help renovate it.

One of the hot trends in notebooks is squeezing desktop processors,
not mobile CPUs, into laptops. Actually, the trend has been around
for a while, but the bigger vendors used to pooh-pooh these
efforts. (Intel was never too crazy about the idea, either.) Now,
it's a bona fide movement, and the latest 9.6-pound desktop-
replacement system from Toshiba takes this trend to new heights.
But questions abound: Are the extra pounds worth it? Do these 
things really get so hot that you can press pants with them?

Always nice to have one to put stuff that overrides RH things. Like if
you absolutely detest qt and some programs are rebuildable from sources
with different %configure options. You can get src.rpm, edit spec, bump
release numberwith your initials and another number and rebuild, insert
into apt and let loose... :)
Doesn't freshrpms have updates dir too? Maybe not quite as up to date as
up2date but still. I would never use up2date. There is another
repository at apt-rpm.tuxfamily.org IIRC. Not sure if that had The
updates.

SmartCards do not have fixed clock rates (more often than not) as the ISO spec 
dictates that they are externally powered and clocked, but SmartCards used 
for security purposes (usually JavaCards) have built-in crypto co-processors 
that make clock rate irrelevant. 4mhz SmartCards can often preform triple-DES 
faster than general purpose processors clocked at ten times the speed.
That said, clock rate has nothing with how trustworthy a card is. As Michael 
pointed out, there's something of an arms-race between manufacturers and 
attackers which has nothing to do with clock rate, and time and time again 
what we've seen is that it's not a question of ""is it secure"", it's a 
question of ""who is it secure from and for how long?"" Security is rarely a 
question of absolutes (despite the often boolean nature of a break), rather 
it's a question of assessing, quantifying, and managing risk. SmartCards are 
designed to address threats in which the cost of protection cannot exceed the 
$1-20 range (depending on the application).
As whether or not they are ""trusted hardware"", the question again revolves 
around attacker and timeframe. One might expect a bored undergrad EE student 
to have more trouble revealing the contents of a pilfered smartcard than, 
say, a governtment intelligence service. If your goal is to keep undergrad 
EEs from perpetrating mass fraud in the caffeteria, then a smartcard is 
likely ""trustworthy"" enough for your application. If your aim is to protect 
ICBM launch codes, then it's probably the wrong tool. In either application, 
a risk/cost ratio must justify the use of the protection measure in question.

Oh well.  Fair enough.

Ugh, way too much manual labor.  :-)
What I've done instead is to create a tiny little ""kernel.spec"" that
installs no files but claims to produce a kernel package having version
number `uname -r` for architecture `uname -p`.  It also claims to
provide kernel-sources at the same version.  That is enough to make
alsa-driver.spec happy, and at least forms a reasonable representation
of what my homemade kernel provides to the system.  I should have
thought of this approach sooner.

If the majority of your photos are posed snapshots and
landscapes, a fast camera may not matter. But if you've ever
missed a shot because your camera was busy processing the
previous photo, the Leica Digilux 1 will appeal to you. We liked
it too, and we gave it an Editors' Choice award.<!--

Microsoft has released a media player for its Xbox game

  Answer to the question from the last newsletter:
  <p>
  Plug your Pocket PC into the USB port on the new TiVo
  Series2, and you can transfer recording onto the handheld to
  watch while you're on the go.
  <p>
  No, this one's false. First of all, none of the proposed
  ""home-entertainment features"" for the Series2 DVRs have been rolled
  out yet. And so far, neither TiVo nor its partners have
  proposed such a feature.

James Rogers <jamesr@best.com>,fork@spamassassin.taint.org,,,,,,unsubscribe,Native American economics (was Re: sed /s/United States/Roman    Empire/g),<B9B9558B.DAC3%jamesr@best.com>,"I wanted to get back to this but didn't have the time.  I actually lived on
a couple different Indian reservations growing up in the Pacific Northwest
and also spent a fair amount time in Lakota/Sioux country as well.  And my
parents have lived on an even more diverse range of Indian reservations than
I have (my experience being a direct result of living with my parents).  I
do get a lot of my information first-hand, or in some cases, second-hand
from my father.
The income figures for the Indians are somewhat misleading, mostly because
it is really hard to do proper accounting of the effective income.  While it
is true that some Indians live in genuine poverty, it is typically as a
consequence of previous poor decisions that were made by the tribe, not
something that was impressed upon them.
The primary problem with the accounting is that there is a tribal entity
that exists separately from the individuals, typically an ""Indian
Corporation"" of one type or another where each member of the tribe owns a
single share (the details of when and how a share becomes active varies from
tribe to tribe).  In most tribes, a dividend is paid out to each of the
tribal members from the corporation, usually to the tune of $10-30k per
person, depending on the tribe.  The dividend money comes from a number of
places, with the primary sources being the Federal Gov't and various
businesses/assets owned by the Indian corporation.
You have to understand a couple things:  First, a great many Indian tribes
are run as purely communist enterprises.  Everyone gets a check for their
share no matter what.  One of the biggest problems this has caused is very
high unemployment (often 70-90%) for tribal members, who are more than happy
take their dividend and not work.  The dividend they receive from the
corporation often constitutes their sole ""income"" for government accounting
purposes.  Unfortunately, to support this type of economics when no one
works, they've had to sell off most of their useful assets to maintain those
dividends.  Many of the tribes genuinely living in poverty do so because
they have run out of things to sell yet nobody works.  One of the ironies is
that on many of the reservations where the tribes still have assets to burn,
many of the people working in the stores and such are actually poor white
folk, not Indians.
Second, even though the tribe members each get a cash dividend, they also
receive an enormous range of benefits and perks from the Indian corporation
to the tune of tens of thousands of dollars per person annually.  By
benefits and perks, we are talking about the kinds of things no other
ordinary American receives from either their employer or the government.
It should be pointed out that while many of these Indian corporations are
ineptly run, and mostly provide sinecures for other Indians, a minority are
very smartly managed and a few hire non-Indian business executives with good
credentials to run their business divisions.  An example of this is the
Haida Corporation, which while having less 1,000 tribal shareholders, has
billions of dollars in assets and the various corporations they own have
gross revenues in the $200-300 million range (and growing).  Yet the
dividend paid out is strictly controlled, about $20k in this particular
case, and they engaged in a practice of waiting a couple decades before
drawing money from any of the assets they were granted which has led to
intelligent investment and use.  They don't eat their seed corn, and have
actually managed to grow their stash.  In contrast, a couple islands over,
there is another tribe of ~2,000 people that has a net loss of about $50
million annually IIRC while being regularly endowed by the Federal
government with several billions of dollars in valuable assets.  This
particular tribe has a modest income in theory, but the actual expenditures
per person annually is in the hundreds of thousands of dollars, and many
borrow money against future income.  Incidentally, in this particular case,
the people that ARE working frequently pull in a few hundred thousand
dollars a year, much of which goes back to the tribal corporation rather
than their own pockets.
Somewhat annoying, the Federal government semi-regularly grants valuable
assets to these tribes when they've burned through the ones previously given
where feasible, typically selling the assets to American or foreign
companies.  And the cycle continues.
So what is the primary problem for the tribes that have problems?  In a
nutshell, a thoroughly pathological culture and society.
Few women reach the age of 16 without getting pregnant.  Incest, rape, and
gross promiscuity is rampant.  Inbreeding, heavy drug abuse during
pregnancy, and other environmental factors have created tribes where a very
substantial fraction of the tribe is literally mentally retarded.  Many of
the thoughtful and intelligent tribe members leave the reservation at the
earliest opportunity, mostly to avoid the problems mentioned above.  On one
reservation my parents lived, the HIV infection rate was >70%.  Many of
these societies are thoroughly corrupt, and the administration of the law is
arbitrary and capricious (they do have their own judges, courts, police
etc).
In short, many of these tribes that are still hanging together are in a
shambles because they have become THE most pathological societies that I
have ever seen anywhere.  Because of their legal status, there really aren't
that many consequences for their behavior.  There are many things that I
could tell you that I've seen that you probably would not believe unless
you'd seen it yourself.  There are always good people in these tribes, but
it has gotten to the point where the losers and idiots outnumber the good
guys by a fair margin many times, and this IS a mobocracy typically.  (BTW,
if any of you white folk wants to experience overt and aggressive racism as
a minority in a place where the rule of law is fiction and the police are
openly thugs, try living on one of these messed up Indian reservations.  It
will give you an interesting perspective on things.)
There are only two real situations where you find reasonably prosperous
Indians.  The first is in the rare case of tribes run by disciplined and
intelligent people that have managed their assets wisely.  The second is
where the tribe has dispersed and assimilated for the most part, even if
they maintain their tribal identity.  In both of these cases, the tribal
leaders reject the insular behavior that tends to lead to the pathological
cases mentioned above.
The Indians are often quite wealthy technically, and a lot of money is spent
by the tribe per capita.  And the actual reportable income is quite high
when you consider how many are living entirely off the tribal dole.  It is
just that their peculiar economic structure does not lend itself well to
ordinary economic analysis by merely looking at their nominal income.  The
poverty is social and cultural in nature, not economic.  This was my
original point.

On a tangent:
One thing that has always interested me is the concept of quasi-tribal
corporate socialism.  Many Indian tribes implement a type of corporate
socialism that is mind-bogglingly bad in execution.  That they use this
structure at all is an accident of history more than anything.  But what has
interested me is that the very smartly managed ones do surprisingly well
over the long run.  It is like a Family Corporation writ large.
It seems that in a future where ""familial"" ties will be increasingly
voluntary, the general concept may have some merit in general Western
society, serving to create a facsimile of a biological extended family with
the included dynamics, but with an arbitrary set of self-selecting
individuals.
Damn that was long (and its late), and it could have been a lot longer.

For consultancy, integration or open source work, sure, perl, python or
java with free use of external libs makes a lot of sense IMO.
I should note that normally when I've used C or C++ in the past, it's
dictated by the fact that I would be working on a commercial product,
written from the ground up, where the code you're generating is important
IP for the company; in this case, using a third-party lib often is not an
option, or would be a PITA licensing-wise.
Also, cutting out third-party dependencies can reduce the risk of ""oops,
there goes the company that makes that library I depend on, now to shop
around for something vaguely similar, figure out what bugs it's got,
rewrite my code to use the new API, and hope for the best"".
This can be a *very* big deal, for obvious reasons ;)    Open source
knockers should note that this is not a problem when using LGPL'd libs ;)

For all my recent packages that support --with and --without options, I've
put them in the %description section. See for instance :
http://psyche.freshrpms.net/rpm.html?id=80
Where you can see :
Available rpmbuild rebuild options :
--with : alsa
--without : aalib lirc libdv arts
The ogle package has also a --with alsa option, and I've had a bug report
about xine that I apparently unintentionally compiled with ALSA directly
:-/
I'd like to aks this on the rpm-zzzlist : Would a new dependency of 250k, the
alsa-lib package, for many packages (mplayer, ogle, xine) be a problem for
the freshrpms.net packages users? As I really feel like blending ALSA in
now, especially since I've just spent some time recompiling alsa-kernel
package for all the Psyche kernels!!!

Claim:   President George W. Bush proclaimed, ""The problem with
the French is that they don't have a word for entrepreneur.""

Origins:   Yet another French fried ""George W. Bush is dumb""
story has been taken up by those who like their caricatures
drawn in stark, bold lines. According to scuttlebutt that
emerged in the British press in July 2002, President Bush,
Britain's Prime Minister Tony Blair, and France's President
Jacques Chirac were discussing economics and, in particular,
the decline of the French economy. ""The problem with the
French,"" Bush afterwards confided in Blair, ""is that they don't
have a word for entrepreneur.""
The source was Shirley Williams, also known as the Baroness
Williams of Crosby, who claimed ""my good friend Tony Blair"" had
recently regaled her with this anecdote in Brighton.
Lloyd Grove of The Washington Post was unable to reach Baroness
Williams to gain her confirmation of the tale, but he did
receive a call from Alastair Campbell, Blair's director of
communications and strategy. ""I can tell you that the prime
minister never heard George Bush say that, and he certainly
never told Shirley Williams that President Bush did say it,""
Campbell told The Post. ""If she put this in a speech, it must
have been a joke.""
This is far from the first time Bush has been made the butt of
a jibe meant to showcase what some perceive as his less than
stellar intellectual abilities. Without straining our memories
too hard, we can come up with three other instances we've
chronicled on this site. In the summer of 2001, the joke of the
moment centered upon a supposed study that had resulted in the
ranking of Presidential IQs, with George W. Bush being pegged
as the Chief Executive who scraped the bottom of the
intelligence barrel. In December 2000 it was a fake Nostradamus
quatrain which pontificated that the ""village idiot"" would win
the 2000 Presidential election. And in the spring of 2002, it
was the story of Bush's waving at Stevie Wonder that set folks
to chortling up their sleeves.
Stories that illustrate this widely believed intellectual
shortcoming will always waft after George W. Bush because they
seemingly confirm what many already hold as true about this
public figure, that he's not the brightest fellow that's ever
been. It is human nature to revel in yarns that the hearer at
some level agrees with, thus tales of this sort will always
fall upon appreciative ears.

list of things I intend to re-read once the fog lifts: 
- _Phil Ringnalda_: Using FOAF relationships[1] and Just say no to Trackback in 
index.html[2]. 
- _Les Orchard_: Per-post comment RSS feed[3]. 
- _Phil Wainewright_: The bare necessities of RSS[4] and What to do about RDF
[5]. The beginning of an RSS 2.0 best practices document. 
- _Jonathon Delacour_: Trying to score a goal[6]. &#8220;As the best and the 
brightest focus on the possibilities of FOAF, I turned my attention to 
yesterday's news: RSS.&#8221; No, RSS will always be today's news. Get it? 
Today's newzzz... Never mind. 
- Comments on Ben Hammersley's Friend of a Friend[7]. Various ways to link to a 
FOAF file from an RSS feed. 
- _Nicholas Chase_: The Web's future: XHTML 2.0[8]. We're losing backward 
compatibility, isn't that great? Well, he seems to think so. 
- mod_cc[9], a module for including copyright information in RDF documents such 
as RSS 1.0 feeds, and, I hope, FOAF files. 
- _Shelley Powers_: Who is your audience, and what are you trying to 
accomplish?[10] Addressing the growing identity crisis on the RSS-DEV mailing 
list[11]. Also the comments on Shelley's article[12]. 
- _Ian Hickson_: Pingback 1.0[13]. &#8220;The best thing about this idea is 
that unlike similar schemes like TrackBack, it is totally transparent to both 
users.&#8221; 
- New software helps in building of accessible web sites[14]. A press release 
for a new edition of LIFT[15], which I have never used. 
- Forget Mars bars, Twinkies now the deep-fried treat[16]. &#8220;The secret to 
making a deep-fried Twinkie, he says, is to place it in the fridge first to 
give it more stability. He then rolls it in flour, covers it with batter ... 
and plunks it into the oil.&#8221;

Several <b>U.S. government</b> agencies have teamed with an international Internet security organization to support a set of 
benchmarks aimed at guaranteeing a <b>minimum security standard</b> for computers. While <b>Windows 2000</b> workstations are 
the first benchmark that the disparate organizations have agreed upon, others to  follow include <b>Cisco IOS</b> for 
routers, Solaris, Linux and HP-UX. Reaching agreement on these benchmarks will not be a walk in the park.

Last year, <b>Steve Ballmer</b> called the GPL on which Linux is based a ""<b>cancer</b>."" This year, <b>Linux is a ""unique

It's been a year since the <b>Code Red</b> worm wreaked havoc on the Net. What's changed? Internet worms have become <b>much

There are specific statutory exemptions to the ""first sale"" principle of
fair use in the US.  For example, audio recordings have such an
exemption (dating from the early '80s IIRC), which is why you can't
(legally) be in the business of renting audio CDs; the creators can
control what you do with it after they've sold it to you.  Certain
industries would like to extend similar exemptions to other products --
there is no theoretical limit to what Congress could revoke such
privileges on.

The problem with the entertainment industry is that they engage in
business and pricing tactics that make anything Microsoft was ever
accused of pale in comparison.  If they can't figure out how to make
money doing something, they'll actually burn money to make sure no
""industry outsider"" can either for all intents and purposes; control is
more important than maximizing profit as long as they can make a
profit.  They don't need your carrot, so they only engage in reasonable
business behavior when you are carrying a very large stick, and few
people swing a stick large enough.  They are being chronically
""investigated"" by the DoJ for anti-trust, collusion, and similar
activities, but that is mostly just for show.
Which isn't to say that the entertainment industry won't fall victim to
its own stupidity, but their ability to do arbitrary and capricious
price manipulation with impunity is going to make it a slow decline.

For goddess' sake Martin that seems to be exactly what you're doing.  You 
started your reply to Tim's posting of the Guardian article by suggesting that 
it was factually inaccurate.  Did you actually read it or did you just assume 
that if the Grauniad writes about a Muslim extremist they must be making him out

or so, and they work reasonably well for asynchronous I/O up to a
hundred or so channels, but suck after that; /dev/poll (available in
Solaris and Linux) is one approach to solving this; Linux has a way to
do essentially the same thing with real-time signals, and has for
years; and FreeBSD has kqueue.
More details about these are at
http://www.citi.umich.edu/projects/linux-scalability/
None of this helps with disk I/O; most programs that need to overlap
disk I/O with computation, on either proprietary Unixes or Linux, just
use multiple threads or processes to handle the disk I/O.
POSIX specifies a mechanism for nonblocking disk I/O that most
proprietary Unixes implement.  The Linux kernel hackers are currently
rewriting Linux's entire I/O subsystem essentially from scratch to
work asynchronously, because they can easily build efficient
synchronous I/O primitives from asynchronous ones, but not the other
way around. So now Linux will support this mechanism too.
It probably doesn't need saying for anyone who's read Beberg saying
things like ""Memory management is a non-issue for anyone that has any
idea at all how the hardware functions,"" but he's totally off-base.
People should know by now not to take anything he says seriously, but
apparently some don't, so I'll rebut.
Not surprisingly, the rebuttal requires many more words than the
original stupid errors.
In detail, he wrote:

Unix acquired nonblocking I/O in the form of select() about 23 years
ago, and Solaris has had the particular aio_* calls we are discussing
for many years.  Very few applications need the aio_* calls ---
essentially only high-performance RDBMS servers even benefit from them
at all, and most of those have been faking it fine for a while with
multiple threads or processes.  This just provides a modicum of extra
performance.

Although I don't have a copy of the spec handy, I think the aio_* APIs
come from the POSIX spec IEEE Std 1003.1-1990, section 6.7.9, which is
13 years old, and which I think documented then-current practice.
They might be even older than that.
Unix has been multiprocess since 1969, and most Unix implementations
have supported multithreading for a decade or more.

Linux's aio_* routines can notify the process of their completion with
a ""signal"", a feature missing in Microsoft Windows; a ""signal"" causes
the immediate execution of a ""signal handler"" in a process.  By
contrast, the Microsoft Windows mechanisms to do similar things (such
as completion ports) do not deliver a notification until the process
polls them.
I don't think signals are a better way to do things in this case
(although I haven't written any RDBMSes myself), but you got the
technical descriptions of the two operating systems exactly backwards.
Most programs that use Linux real-time signals for asynchronous
network I/O, in fact, block the signal in question and poll the signal
queue in a very Windowsish way, using sigtimedwait() or sigwaitinfo().

* Judge Grants Consumer Voice in ReplayTV Lawsuit
  Hollywood Tries to Skip Over Consumers' Concerns
Los Angeles - Judge Florence Cooper today granted five ReplayTV owners
a voice in the court debate over their rights to record television
programs and to skip commercials using digital video recorders (DVRs).
The federal court denied the entertainment industry motion to dismiss
the ReplayTV owners' lawsuit and agreed to combine the consumer
lawsuit with an entertainment industry lawsuit filed last fall to ban
ReplayTV DVRs.
""We're pleased the court has recognized that the debate about digital
video recorders must include the customers who purchase and use the
devices,"" said Electronic Frontier Foundation (EFF) Intellectual
Property Attorney Robin Gross.
""[T]he issue of whether the Newmark Plaintiffs' use of the ReplayTV
DVRs' send-show and commercial-skipping features constitutes fair use
will most likely figure prominently in both the ReplayTV action and
the Newmark action,"" wrote Judge Cooper in her opinion.
Responding to the entertainment industry's lawsuit against DVR
manufacturers, EFF petitioned the court on behalf of the five ReplayTV
owners to declare legal their use of the digital devices also known as
personal video recorders (PVRs). EFF seeks to ensure that the legal
debate over DVRs will include consumers' concerns along with those of
the entertainment and consumer electronics industries.
The entertainment industry claims that commercial skipping infringes
copyright and digital recording aids piracy.
""I'm not a crook if I skip commercials or share a news interview of
myself with my mom using the SendShow feature rather than sending her
a videotape,"" said Craig Newmark, founder of craigslist.org and a
ReplayTV owner. ""I shouldn't have to worry about getting prosecuted,
but the Turner Broadcasting CEO tells us that taking a bathroom break
is criminal. We even have Senators urging Attorney General Ashcroft to
prosecute people who share files.""
Along with Newmark, ReplayTV customers filing the lawsuit with legal
representation by the EFF are: Keith Ogden, owner of a financial
broker firm in San Francisco; Shawn Hughes, a small business owner in
Georgia; Seattle journalist Glenn Fleishman; and southern Californian
video engineer Phil Wright.

* Musician Disputes Industry's Stance on Music Sharing
  Janis Ian Urges Artists Speak Out, Support Free Downloads
San Francisco - Grammy-winning songwriter and recording artist Janis
Ian today challenged the music industry by celebrating peer-to-peer
(P2P) music sharing as a boon to musicians.
Ian, who is in the San Francisco Bay Area as part of her current
concert tour, recently published ""The Internet Debacle,"" a pointed
critique of the music industry's disregard for musicians and consumers
who want to distribute and acquire music online. The Electronic
Frontier Foundation (EFF) applauds Ian's actions and hopes that others
will see the Internet as an aid, not a threat, to musicians.
In the article, Ian assails the major record labels' argument that P2P
file-sharing is harming artists.
""Free Internet downloads are good for the music industry and its
artists,"" explains Ian. ""Every act that can't get signed to a major,
for whatever reason, can reach literally millions of new listeners,
enticing them to buy the CD and come to the concerts.""
She adds that during the heyday of Napster she saw a marked increase
in CD sales from her website. She attacks technological and political
measures meant to harm consumers by restricting their right to copy
and back up their legally purchased music.
Ian will play on August 17 in San Rafael, CA.
During her 17 album career, Ian has earned nine Grammy nominations and
three awards. Her best known songs include 1967's ""Society's Child""
and 1975's ""At Seventeen."" More recently, her 1993 album ""Breaking
Silence"" was nominated for a Grammy Award as Contemporary Folk Album
of the Year. Her songs have been recorded by artists ranging from
Bette Midler to Cher, from Glen Campbell to Vanilla Fudge, and from
Joan Baez to Etta James.

* Court Hearing Set in DeCSS Publication Jurisdiction Case
On September 5, 2002, the California Supreme Court will hear oral
arguments about whether a California court has jurisdiction over
Matthew Pavlovich, an Indiana college student who is a resident of
Texas, for his hosting of an Internet mailing list. Pavlovich
maintained the mailing list for the LiVid programming group, which
provides a unified development and user resource center for video and
DVD-related work for the Linux operating system. One of the group's
projects was to create a DVD player for computer systems that run
Linux. As part of that effort, DeCSS, a program that decrypts the copy
protection on DVDs, was published on the group's mailing list. The
entertainment industry has sued Pavlovich in California court, and
last year a California appellate court ruled Pavlovich was within the
state court's jurisdiction since he published information that relates
to the entertainment industry, which is based in California.
EFF and Pavlovich's legal team argue that Pavlovich is outside of
California's jurisdiction since he was a college student in Indiana
with no contacts to California when DeCSS was published on the LiVid
list. The hearing on September 5 will take place in San Francisco.

This sounds like something piggy in the 'flist' code - I'm seeing flist
in general taking 5-10 seconds.  Interesting that a different wish comes up
fast, there might be a borkedness in 8.4.

I've been seeing this as well - *usually* with inbox, but it's gotten
stuck on some other folders as well (I have procmail do rcvstore into folders
for me).

To all you Dream Theater fans out there, please accept my humblest of apologies. 
I mistakenly announced their break up in the last GnomeAudio section, causing 
quite a stir among a number of subscribers. In fact, they just released a double 
album this year and have been touring in support of that release. 
For today's false alarm, please make note of the tragedy that is the N'SYNC 
breakup (oh wait, that's just wishful thinking).

I know I've already carried on about my Kyocera 6035 phone, but this thing is 
awesome.  I've got all my contacts in one device. Web browsing is good - I'm 
sure it would be better on a color screen, like the 
<a href=""http://www.handspring.com/products/treo270/index.jhtml?sub_nav_section=Overview&prod_cat_name=Treo270"">Treo 270</a>, but for what I'll need, 
this works well. I'm currently looking for an ssh client I can install, so that 
remote server logins will be possible. My one complaint is the base station's 
use of a serial connector instead of USB, but I suppose they were cutting costs.

(PML) standard for marking up Palm Docs, 
in an effort to make the GnomeTomes a little flashier. I've installed several of 
the files on my phone and while they are easy to read, have all the content 
organized, and function as useful tips for the various subjects, I'd like to add 
some minor tweaks to future tomes, so that they look even better for me and 
anyone else who reads them on their Palm.

Of the formats Lockergnome uses for our GnomeTomes, TomeRaider is by far my 
favorite. Designed with a feel similar to CHM, the TR format is quite easy 
to read, as it places section titles in a pane separate from content, 
allowing you, the reader, to navigate through our tips (or anything else) 
with much greater ease than the linear format the other versions present. 
The Windows version of the software is truly designed with ease of use in 
mind. Creating ebooks for TomeRaider is a simple matter of combining a 
modified set of HTML tags with the <new> designation for page breaks. The 
only trick for Yankees like me is remembering that center is tagged centre 
in the software.

Triumph the dog is low-tech, he's not cute like the pets.com sock puppet,

Episode II. Whether you've been one of those geeks yourself, or you've 
never understood why anyone would dress up and wait in line for a movie, 
you'll still find this film amusing. 10 minutes was more than necessary 
to get the point across, yet Triumph delivers enough one-liners 
throughout to keep you watching all the way to the end.

Classic jazz vocal styling, juxtaposing arrangements of contemporary

beautiful piano arrangements, Heleen's voice is a thing of beauty. A 
Netherlands native,  who originally dreamed of saving the rainforests 
(at least according to her biography), her interpretation of American 
jazz standards and show tunes is more remarkable than most native 
English speaking vocalists. No world tour is currently scheduled, so 
you'll probably have to journey to Europe to see her in person, but 
for those of you living elsewhere in the world, the Internet makes a 
fabulous venue for experiencing Heleen  van den Hombergh's talent.

<p class=""url"">Special DVD Features worth a look-Thornton and Coen Brothers Commentary</p>
Much more film noir, than a movie trying to imitate film noir, The Man
Who Wasn't There captures the inevitable hopelessness of the genre. Ed
Crane (Billy Bob Thornton) is the archetype everyman. A barber by trade,
Crane represents the individual in society. He hears everything, but
truly knows nothing. Everything he hears is modified ever so slightly by
the retelling. He gets neither the whole story nor the true motivations.
Left to guess at the motivations and desires of those around him, Crane
develops an indifference to it all. When a snake oil sales man slithers
into town, Crane takes this opportunity to cheat the cheaters and punish
the punishers.  As indifferent as Crane appears, he is no match for the
amorality of fate. As much as fate is indifferent in its wrath, however,
so is it artistic in its execution. That is what makes our lives so
entertaining. Fate doles ultimate justice, but never as expected. The
Man Who Wasn't There is truly a Kafkaesque tale of an individual's year
to turn against the tide of inevitability. Atypical of cuter, more
recent Coen brothers fare, this film is reminiscent of their earlier
noir works like Blood Simple and Miller's Crossing. Frances McDormand
does an outstanding job making as Crane's selfish wife and James
Gandolfini exudes boorishness as Doris' boss. The real outstanding
performances, however, rest with the supporting cast. Tony Shalhoub, as
pompus attorney Freddy Riedenschneider and  Jon Polito as the snake oil
salesman impress and entertain as cruel, but offbeat parodies of their
characters. The black and white cinematography by Roger Deakins also
impresses and precisely underscores the bleakness of Crane's life and
the monochromatic nature of fate.

spam fighting software.
I was looking at my spamd debug output today, and noticed that it ran
through Razor2 stuff, and then it ran through dccproc, and then it tried to
go through old Razor1 stuff.  I'm assuming (and please correct me if I'm
wrong) that Razor1 is out dated and was to be replaced entirely by Razor2.
If that's the case, can someone please point me to something that explains
how to remove Razor1 from my system?  I don't see a point in envoking it.
Especially when it appears to error out on me.
debug: Razor1 is available
debug: entering helper-app run mode
debug: Razor Agents 1.19, protocol version 2.
debug: 170803 seconds before closest server discovery
debug: Agent terminated
Problem while trying to load Razor1: Permission denied  at

debug: leaving helper-app run mode
Thanks!

<font size=3><b>Battered stocks regain ground</b></font><br>
Led by a surge in chip titan Intel, beaten-down technology shares rose Thursday.
<p>
Despite a Merrill Lynch downgrade of Yahoo to ""reduce/sell"", the Internet portal rose after posting better-than-expected second-quarter results and also helped lift the sector. CNET's Tech index gained 29.87 points, or 3.11 percent, to close at 995.16. The tech-laden Nasdaq composite index tacked on 28.42 points, or 2.11 percent, to close at 1,374.43--after hitting a five-year low Wednesday.
<p>
Broader markets were mixed amid news wholesale prices rose slightly and drug firm Bristol-Myers Squibb is being probed by the Securities and Exchange Commission. The Dow Jones industrial average fell 12.0 points, or 0.14 percent, to close at 8,801.5. The S&P 500 added 6.9 points, or 0.75 percent, to close at 927.37, after it too reached a five-year low Wednesday.

Hewlett-Packard is trying to beat the heat with summer deals on PCs.
For retail buyers in the United States, the company is offering several new rebate or promotional programs, designed to stimulate demand for its PCs, going into the back-to-school shopping season. Some of the deals include a new $200 mail-in rebate on desktops, while others offer instant $50 rebates.<br><B>HEWLETT-PACKARD CO 15.23 -0.13% </B>

The PayPal-eBay merger has hit an early snag: Two shareholder lawsuits have been filed against the companies seeking to block the deal.
The lawsuits, each filed in Delaware Chancery Court earlier this week on behalf of PayPal shareholders, charge that the deal represents a breach of the companies' fiduciary duty to those shareholders and that the price eBay is paying for PayPal is unfair and inadequate, the companies said in separate regulatory filings on Thursday.<br><B>EBAY INC 60.38 2.63% </B>

Europe's biggest software maker, SAP AG, shocked the market on Thursday by unexpectedly cutting its sales forecast and missing analysts' forecast for the second quarter.
The company said it would post a net loss of 235 million euros ($232 million) and said it was taking a non-recurring accounting charge of 414 million euros to cover impairments of minority investments in the United States, including a 318 million euros charge from its 20 percent stake in Commerce One.<br><B>SAP AKTIENGESELLSCHAFT ADS 19.70 -7.73% </B>

Analysts Justin Baldauf and Tim Gernitis cut their intermediate-term rating on the Internet giant from ""neutral"" to ""reduce/sell"" and their long-term rating from ""strong buy"" to ""neutral"" after seeing Yahoo's second-quarter results. Although the results look solid at first, Baldauf and Gernitis say Yahoo's growth was driven entirely by new initiatives. They also argue the firm's improved outlook seems driven completely by the Overture deal extension. Eventually, these initiatives will result in much lower growth rates, the analysts say. They argue Yahoo's stock price isn't supported by the firm's fundamentals.<br><B>YAHOO INC 12.92 5.99% </B><br>

White House: President's ""War Boner"" Must Be Satisfied
...""The President can't seem to hide his excitement about a possible
military conflict with Iraq. At a recent function honoring America's
war widows, Bush sported a visible erection when his speech turned to
the subject of the Middle East.
'Believe me when I say this. With or without the help of other
nations, with or without UN approval, we will penetrate Iraq's
borders. With overwhelming force, we will pound Iraq over and over
again without ceasing. And, once its leaders concede defeat, we will
seed Iraq with American-style democracy.'
Aides say the podium was scrubbed down thoroughly after the event with
a special cleanser/biocide not used since the Clinton
administration."".....
