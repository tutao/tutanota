# Translating Tuta

The Tuta apps are available in more than 40 languages, most of which have been translated by volunteers.
We are using [POEditor](https://poeditor.com) to manage the translation project. 
Thanks to them for approving the Tuta clients for their generous open source program!

If you're interested in improving one of the available language versions or even start a new one, drop us a message at [hello@tutao.de](mailto:hello@tutao.de)!
