This is the preamble.  It is to be ignored, though it
is a handy place for mail composers to include an
explanatory note to non-MIME conformant readers.
--simple boundary
Content-type: text/plain; charset=us-ascii; name="/foo/bar"


--simple boundary
Content-type: text/plain; charset=us-ascii; name="foo bar"

This is explicitly typed plain ASCII text.
It DOES end with a linebreak.


--simple boundary
Content-type: text/plain; charset=us-ascii; name="foobar"

This is explicitly typed plain ASCII text.
It DOES end with a linebreak.

--simple boundary--
This is the epilogue.  It is also to be ignored.
