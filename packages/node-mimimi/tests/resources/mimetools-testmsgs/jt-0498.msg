Hello to all, 

I purchased a tall windshield about two weeks ago from Waynesville Cycle
Center in NC.  The entire length and width of the windshield has optical waves
or ripples which distort the view through it.  It was very uncomfortable to
ride with and I would be afraid to ride at night with it.

I contacted the manager at WCC.  He in turn contacted Honda Customer Service
(310-532-9811).  They replied to him that there were no bulletins concerning
this problem and that they inspected several windshields.  They claim that all
the windshields had distortions.  They have offered to give me a full refund.

What bothers me is two things.  First, the stock windshield has no optical
distortion.  Second, it appears that Honda knows that it is selling a less
than perfect product and is apparently unconcerned about it (seems like a
strange way to do business).  

Perhaps my windshield is the worst one ever made, but they made no offer to
inspect mine and compare to others that they have in stock.

I am going to call Honda on Monday and raise the issues of safety and quality.
I will ask them if they have a problem with me forwarding their position to
publications such as Cycle World, Rider, etc.
