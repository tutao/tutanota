## tutanota-utils

This is a collection of common test utils we use across multiple projects/modules internally. As creating this module
really is just an intermediate step towards re-organising some of the dependency structure of our software, it is most
likely going to change a lot in the future and might even disappear altogether. For these reasons **we strongly
discourage anyone outside of our organisation to directly depend on this module**.
