 *  - compile time check that migration exists and is used in this file
 *  - runtime check that runtime model is compatible to the stored one after all the migrations are done.
 *
 *  To add a new migration create a migration with the filename matching ./migrations/{app}-v{version}.ts and use it in the `migrations` field on this
 *  migrator.
 *
 *  Migrations might read and write to the database and they should use StandardMigrations when needed.
